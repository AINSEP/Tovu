/**
 * @file The one typed catalog of every plugin hook point (hooks v2 plan §3.1, "one source of
 * truth"). `HOOK_POINTS` is DATA, not a hand-copied vocabulary — core's manifest validator
 * (`VALID_HOOKS`), `tovu hooks list`, `tovu introspect`, and the `/plugin-api` docs page all derive
 * from this one array, so a name typed here is the only place it needs to be typed.
 *
 * A hook enters `HOOK_POINTS` only in the slice that wires its real core call site (§3.1's own
 * rule) — a declared-but-unwired hook is never a deliverable. `content.entry.beforeSave` is the
 * only entry as of this file's introduction (S1): it is the v1 hook, already fully wired
 * (`hook-registry.ts`).
 *
 * `HookSignatures` is the companion TYPE map — one entry per `HOOK_POINTS` name, giving its
 * `kind` and payload shape(s) so `addFilter`/`addAction`/`addContribution` can be generic over
 * `keyof HookSignatures` instead of one hand-written overload per hook. `FilterHookName` /
 * `ActionHookName` / `ContributionHookName` are derived FROM `HookSignatures`, not written by
 * hand, so a hook's `kind` can never drift between the catalog and the type map.
 *
 * Depends on `ContentEntryDraft`/`ExtPatch` from `./index.js` via `import type` only (erased at
 * build — no runtime circular dependency), because `index.ts` re-exports THIS file's `HOOK_POINTS`
 * (a runtime value) in the other direction.
