/**
 * @file `@tovu/sdk` — the entire plugin-author public contract (SPEC-005 REQ-08, ADR-005 rule 1,
 * ADR-024 §3 ABI freeze).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * This file IS the public API. Everything a plugin's `server/index.mjs` may import from
 * `@tovu/sdk` is exported here and nowhere else — the runtime's internal core modules are never
 * reachable through this package (enforced by `package.json`'s `exports` map, not by this file). Hook
 * names, capability tokens, and the `definePlugin`/`PluginSdk` shapes are part of this public
 * surface and follow the ADR-005 deprecation ladder — changing any exported name/shape here is
 * an ecosystem-breaking change once a third-party plugin exists (ADR-005 "the compatibility
 * promise must exist before the first third-party plugin").
 *
 * ADR-024 §3 ABI compliance (ties REQ-05/REQ-08 to the newer governing ADR, ratified after this
 * spec's original approval): every hook is treated as always-awaited by core regardless of
 * whether a given filter function is itself `async` (`BeforeSaveFilter`'s return type is
 * `ExtPatch | Promise<ExtPatch>`); `ContentEntryDraft` is a plain, structured-clone-safe snapshot
 * — never a live ORM entity or class instance; and the `PluginSdk` object a plugin receives is a
 * freshly-built handle of plain closures, never a reference to a live core singleton. This file
 * only declares the TYPES for that contract; the runtime object satisfying `PluginSdk` (with its
 * capability-gated stub-vs-absent behavior, CIC U-003) is built by
 * `src/features/plugin-runtime/capability-sdk.ts` inside core, not here — this package has zero
 * dependency on `src/` (Module Map: "Must never import anything from `src/` — it is consumed by
 * plugin code, not by core").
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * TDD-certified implementation (implementation outline C-001…C-004). Signatures and JSDoc are
 * design-frozen; `definePlugin()` is a pure identity wrap — no side effects, no I/O — that exists
 * for the plugin author's type inference; `loadPlugin()` in `plugin-runtime/loader.ts` is what
 * actually invokes the wrapped `definition.setup(sdk)`. Verified against
 * `__tests__/unit/sdk-public-api.unit.test.ts`.
 */

/** C-004 — the exactly-three v1 capability tokens (REQ-04). A manifest declaring any other
 * string is `invalid` with `CAPABILITY_UNKNOWN` (validated in `plugin-runtime/manifest.ts`, not
