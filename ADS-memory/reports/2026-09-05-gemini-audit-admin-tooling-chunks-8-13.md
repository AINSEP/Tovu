# Gemini 3.8 Flash Adversarial Audit — chunks 8-13 (continuation)

Continuation of `2026-09-05-gemini-audit-admin-tooling.md` (chunks 1-7). That report stopped at 7 of ~13
planned chunks; this report runs the remaining chunks 8-13, the items listed under "NOT COVERED" in its
coverage map (lines 70-84).

Scope: commits committed 2026-09-03 and 2026-09-04 (plus any spillover into 2026-09-05 touching the same
files), base commit `ec4fb6e8` (parent of the earliest in-scope commit, same base the prior report used),
branch `restructure/apps-website-phased`.

Method: diffs and/or full current file text fed to `agy --model gemini-3.8-flash-high --effort high` in
print mode, no tool access given to Gemini — all context supplied in-prompt. Every finding Gemini raised was
checked against the actual source at the actual line before being recorded here. No tests, coverage, or
typecheck were run (machine constraint — parallel test agents crashed it earlier today at load 721); findings
that would require a test run to confirm are marked UNVERIFIED. Standing owner-accepted decisions (CI
billing-block, `.outcome`-defeats-continue-on-error being intended, todays's SSRF/TLS/media-gate fixes being
already landed, the three owner-ratified "STAYS LOCAL" inline-.tsx files, flat `??`/`||` fallback chains being
idiomatic) were preloaded into every Gemini prompt and are not re-litigated below.

STATUS: IN PROGRESS — this skeleton is committed first; sections below are appended and committed after each
chunk completes.

## Coverage map (chunks 8-13)

- [ ] Chunk 8 — `apps/admin/src/features/media/Media.tsx` (~363-line diff / complexity-split refactor)
- [ ] Chunk 9 — `apps/admin/src/features/collections/Collections.tsx` (~268-line diff)
- [ ] Chunk 10 — `apps/admin/src/features/menus/MenuEditor.tsx` (~114-line diff) + its own unit-test changes
- [ ] Chunk 11 — hooks-extraction refactor sweep: Pages, Posts, ThemeExplore, AiAssistant,
      ThemePageDetailsModal, `apps/admin/src/features/pages/**` — no-logic-in-`.tsx` rule compliance
- [ ] Chunk 12 — `apps/admin/vite.config.ts` + `development/scripts/dev.mjs` (dev-server TLS plumbing), plus
      `src-complexity-debt.json` / `admin-complexity-debt.json` / `check-architecture.baseline.json` diffs
- [ ] Chunk 13 — test-quality pass: `AccessTokensTab.credential-flows.unit.test.tsx`,
      `use-access-tokens.unit.test.tsx`, `api-endpoint-option-branches.unit.test.ts`, `dead-path-sweep.test.ts`,
      `check-governance-adr-scope-drift.test.ts`, `backfill-custom-credential-usernames.test.ts`
