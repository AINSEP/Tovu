 * those orderings through a threaded-params version, under this pass's own time budget, is how a
 * metric improves and one of those bugs quietly comes back. `use-settings-slice.hooks.ts`'s own
 * history is the cited precedent (brief §9): a previous attempt at exactly this kind of extraction

   * The port, read through a ref so its identity is not a dependency of anything.
   *
   * The obvious alternative — listing `port` in each `useCallback` below — makes referential
   * stability a load-bearing, unenforceable contract on every caller. It is unenforceable because
   * the natural way to write the injection is the broken one:
   * `useChats={() => useAssistantChats(createFakeAssistantChatsPort())}` builds a new port per
   * render, so `refresh` changes identity, its effect re-runs, `setConversations` re-renders, and
   * it spins forever. Documenting "must be stable" only converts that into a trap with a footnote.
   *
   * A ref removes the contract instead of restating it: reads always see the latest port, and no
   * callback identity depends on it. Nothing here wants to *react* to a port swap — a new port does
   * not mean new conversation state — so there is no behaviour to lose.
   *
   * Captured ONCE at mount and never written again — not during render, and not in an effect.
   *
   * Both of the obvious spellings leak. A render-phase `portRef.current = port` publishes a value
   * from a render React may still discard (a `startTransition`, a suspended tree), so an event from
   * the still-committed old tree calls through a port that never committed. Moving it to an effect
   * fixes that and opens a different hole: React runs a CHILD's effects before its parent's in the
   * same commit, and `ChatPane` is a child of this hook's caller — so a delta forwarded from
   * `ChatPane`'s own effect, in the commit where `port` changed, reaches `flush` before this hook's
   * sync effect has run and reads the OUTGOING port. `useLayoutEffect` does not help: layout effects
   * are also child-first. The two spellings trade one gap for the other.
   *
   * So do not track the swap at all. Nothing here wants to react to one — a new port does not mean
   * new conversation state — and "permanently fixed at mount" is an honest contract where
   * "eventually consistent, with a window" is a latent bug. A caller that genuinely needs a

   * *immediately*, while `initialMessages` still holds the conversation being navigated away from.
   * `ChatPane` reads `initialMessages` at mount only, so the fresh transcript — arriving a tick
   * later — was silently discarded and the pane displayed the previous chat's messages under the
   * new chat's title.
   *
   * The display fault was the mild half. The pane then reported that stale transcript through
   * `onMessagesChange`, and because `writtenRef` for the newly selected conversation was still
   * empty, every one of those messages was queued as an unsaved message *belonging to the new
   * conversation*. Observed live: selecting an empty chat fired four `PUT`s carrying the previous
   * chat's messages. They 404'd only because those message ids already existed under their real
   * conversation — an accident of the primary key, not a safeguard. Seeding `writtenRef` in the
   * same commit as the id is what actually closes that hole.
   *
   * React batches both setters (and the ref write precedes them), so the pane remounts exactly
