/**
 * @file Auto-collapse the side nav to its icon rail while the assistant dock is open on a window too
 * narrow for both (owner, 2026-10-11: "horrendous" — nav expanded + dock open left the page a
 * phone-width column whose centred rows clipped at the left edge).
 *
 * The rule, chosen as the least surprising of the options: at desktop widths the nav always PUSHES
 * the page (it is a flex sibling, never an overlay); only when the expanded nav (232px) + the dock
 * (380px) + the page's padding would leave the page under {@link MIN_PAGE_WIDTH_PX} does opening the
 * dock fold the nav to its 60px rail. Closing the dock (or widening the window out of that band)
 * puts back whatever the operator's stored preference is. It never persists anything itself, never
 * fights the operator: expanding the nav by hand while the dock is open sticks until the next
 * dock-open or band crossing. Phones/tablets (≤900px) are untouched — there the nav is already the
 * off-canvas drawer with a backdrop (`styles.css`'s RESPONSIVE SHELL), which has no rail.
 *
 * Mechanism: Jini's Sidebar owns the saved preference and accepts a temporary `railOverride`.
 * This hook supplies only the dock/viewport rule and controlled toggle requests: no storage reads,
 * writes or synthetic events. A manual toggle changes the override until the next forcing transition;
 * releasing it reveals the package's current stored preference (including real cross-tab updates).
