/**
 * @file Standing-draft autosave (2026-09-06 dispatch, owner's own words: "even if they haven't
 * saved it, temp save it whenever they make a draft... it's just saving to... the database. It
 * should be a standing draft anytime something is updated"). Persists to the server
 * (`server/inbound/admin-http/routes/posts/autosave.ts`, `posts.autosave_json`) so a reload or an
 * accidental exit never loses unsaved edits — browser storage alone was rejected.
 *
 * Feature-agnostic on purpose, matching `use-dirty-guard.hooks.ts`'s own precedent: nothing here
 * imports `features/posts` or `features/pages`, so `PostEditorPort`/`PageEditorPort` each satisfy
 * {@link StandingDraftAutosavePort} structurally (same three method shapes, declared independently
 * per that DI-seam convention) with zero cross-feature import. This is the mechanism that lets one
 * implementation serve both editors with no branch between them.
 *
 * Two things this hook does NOT do, deliberately:
 * - Never auto-applies a recovered draft. {@link StandingDraftAutosaveController.recoverableDraft}
 *   is exposed for the caller to render an explicit "restore or discard" banner; silently splicing
 *   in a recovered draft is dangerous with two tabs or two operators open on the same entry.
 * - Never compares `recoverableDraft.baseVersion` against the entry's current version itself — the
 *   caller (which already has the freshly-loaded record) decides whether to label a recovered draft
 *   "outdated" because a real save happened since it was captured.
 *
 * STALE BASIS (added 2026-09-06, fixing silent data loss). `putAutosave` answers `{ applied }`, and
 * `applied: false` means the row's `version` moved under this tab — another tab or operator saved,
 * so every further write against this basis will be refused too (the guard is
 * `apps/website/src/features/post/repo.sqlite.ts`'s `writeAutosave`). That flag used to be thrown
 * away: the hook kept firing refused ticks forever, nothing was ever parked, and a reload produced
 * no recovery banner because there was nothing to recover — an hour of typing could vanish with the
 * operator never told anything. Now a refusal:
 * 1. records {@link StandingDraftStaleBasis} (exposed so the editor can say something true),
 * 2. stops scheduling further writes until the caller supplies a draft on a DIFFERENT `baseVersion`
 *    — i.e. until the editor reloads the row; no manual reset call is needed,
 * 3. mirrors the refused text into `lib/standing-draft-local-backup.ts`, the only place it can
 *    survive a tab close while the server refuses it, and offers it back through the existing
 *    `recoverableDraft` banner on the next mount when the server has nothing parked.
 * The operator's in-memory text is never touched by any of this.
 *
 * The gate and the mirror have DIFFERENT lifetimes on purpose. The gate lifts the instant the
 * caller edits on a fresh basis; the mirror survives until the server has actually accepted a write
 * (or a real Save/discard superseded it), because between those two moments nothing has been
 * persisted anywhere and the mirror is still the only copy of the refused text that outlives the
 * tab. Collapsing the two back into one "clear it all" step reintroduces a window in which a failed
 * request loses the work.
