/**
 * @file One settings-dialog tab's load/edit/debounced-save lifecycle,
 * generic over the tab's own config type.
 *
 * This was `SettingsUi.tsx`'s inline machinery when exactly one tab (Execution
 * mode) was mounted. It is extracted rather than copied because the logic is
 * subtle out of proportion to its size — successive audits have found FOUR
 * distinct data-loss bugs in it (see `saveTicket`, `hasUnsavedEdits`, `runSave`,
 * and `commits` below), and every one of those hazards is identical for every
 * tab. Duplicating it per tab would mean re-introducing all four bugs three
 * more times, and fixing them in three more places.
 *
 * The last two share one root cause worth stating plainly, because it is the
 * shape every future bug here will take: **a value read at schedule time is a
 * claim about the store that may already be false by the time the code using it
 * runs.** `runSave` fixes it for writes by reading the diff base at run time;
 * `commits` fixes it for reads by discarding a reload whose response predates a
 * write that landed while it was in flight. Anything added here that captures
 * `persisted` or `latest` across an `await` needs the same treatment.
 *
 * Each mounted tab owns one instance. They are independent by construction:
 * separate debounce timers, separate save chains, separate diff bases. The
 * only shared surface is the merged status the page chrome renders, which
 * `SettingsUi.tsx` derives.

 * `saveTicket`, `hasUnsavedEdits`, `commits`, `mounted`) plus the shared `writes` lane, and several of

 * (`onChange` schedules a link that calls `runSave`; the unmount cleanup calls `runSave` directly),
 * so none of them can become a top-level function without threading that whole ref set through as a
 * parameter object. This file's own header states the reason that is dangerous here specifically:
 * "a value read at schedule time is a claim about the store that may already be false by the time
 * the code using it runs," and every ref above exists because an earlier version of exactly this
 * logic got that ordering wrong (four distinct data-loss bugs, per the header). A previous pass
 * already tried this kind of extraction on this file and the total was unchanged, 25 → 25 — the
 * honest reading of that result is that the remaining closures do not have a top-level-shaped cut
 * available at the risk level a time-boxed pass allows, not that the attempt was done wrong.
 * Declined for the remainder; flagged to the coordinator. See this session's report for the full
