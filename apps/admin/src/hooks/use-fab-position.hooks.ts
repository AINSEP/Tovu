/**
 * @file Draggable position for the assistant `ChatFab` (MSG-09).
 *
 * Own hook, not inline state in `ChatFab.tsx` — the same reasoning as `useSidebarRail`: this is
 * real, testable-on-its-own behavior (persistence, clamping, free-drag), and `apps/admin/INFO.md`'s
 * hook convention is where it lives. No `-port.hooks.ts` / `-dependencies.hooks.ts` pair, for the
 * same reason as `useSidebarRail`: the only outside dependency is `localStorage`, a browser
 * built-in, not a swappable backend worth a fake-port seam.
 *
 * Position is persisted as **two independent 0–1 fractions of the viewport** —
 * `rightFraction` (distance from the right edge, as a fraction of `innerWidth`) and
 * `bottomFraction` (distance from the bottom edge, as a fraction of `innerHeight`) — never raw
 * pixels. This is the same class of bug the pre-existing `.chat-fab-dock-open { right:
 * calc(380px + 20px) }` rule had (see `styles/assistant.css`'s old comment): a pixel position
 * valid at the viewport it was set on can be off-screen at a different one (window resized,
 * phone rotated). A pair of fractions is resolution-independent by construction — re-deriving
 * pixels on every render/resize instead of trusting a stored pixel value is what actually fixes
 * the class of bug, not just one instance of it.
 *
 * An earlier version of this hook additionally snapped the drop point to whichever edge it was
 * nearer, and persisted `{ side: "left" | "right", bottomFraction }` — a shape that can only ever
 * express a position glued to one vertical edge, which is why a drop in the middle of the screen
 * used to jump to a corner. That snap is gone: the FAB rests exactly where it is dropped,
 * anywhere on screen. The old `{ side, bottomFraction }` value is still read and migrated, not
 * discarded — see `readPersisted` below — so an existing user's FAB does not jump to the default
 * corner on first load after this change.

 * @param options.dockOpen When the assistant dock/sheet is open, an UNTOUCHED or migrated-legacy

 *   accident — this mirrors what the old hard-coded `.chat-fab-dock-open` rule did for the
 *   desktop-docked panel, generalized to the dragged position and to the mobile sheet's own
 *   (viewport-fraction) height. A spot the operator explicitly dragged onto the dock is left alone
 *   (see `pinnedByUser`'s own doc on `StoredFabPosition`) — this option only guards against an
 *   unintentional overlap, not against a deliberate one.
 * @param options.avoidBottomPx Extra clearance to hold above the bottom edge while `dockOpen` —
 *   the caller passes the mobile sheet's current height here (0 at desktop, where the dock sits
 *   to the *side*, not below, so no bottom clearance is needed there — see `App.tsx`).
 * @param options.avoidRightPx Extra clearance to hold left of the right edge while `dockOpen` —
 *   the caller passes the DESKTOP dock's current width here (0 in sheet mode, where the sheet
 *   spans the full width and `avoidBottomPx` is the axis that matters).
 *
 *   This axis was missing until 2026-08-05, and its absence was a live defect rather than a
 *   theoretical gap: the FAB is `position: fixed` and offset from the RIGHT edge, and the desktop
 *   dock is also pinned to the right edge, so with the dock open the 56px FAB sat directly on top
 *   of the dock's own composer send button and swallowed its clicks. Playwright caught it as
 *   `<button class="chat-fab chat-fab-dock-open"> intercepts pointer events` while trying to send
 *   a message — i.e. the assistant could not be used with a mouse at the default FAB position.
 *
 *   How it got lost is worth recording, because the code confidently said otherwise: the old
 *   `.chat-fab-dock-open { right: calc(380px + 20px) }` rule moved the FAB SIDEWAYS. When this
 *   hook replaced it, only the vertical axis was carried over, while the comment on
 *   `effectiveBottom` below claimed `avoidBottomPx` "generalizes" what that rule did — it does
 *   not, it generalizes a different axis, and desktop passes `avoidBottomPx: 0`, so on desktop
 *   nothing displaced the FAB at all. The `.chat-fab-dock-open` class is still applied by
 *   `ChatFab.tsx` and has had no CSS rule behind it since.
 *
 *   Measured by the caller rather than hard-coded back to 380px, for the same
 *   resolution-independence reason this whole hook exists (see the module doc).
 *
 * @complexity O(1) per pointer event — no work scales with anything caller-controlled.
