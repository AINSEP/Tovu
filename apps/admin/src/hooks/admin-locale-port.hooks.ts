/**
 * @file What `use-admin-locale.hooks.ts` needs from the outside world, as an interface rather than
 * direct `lib/settings-tabs`/`lib/settings-refresh-bus` imports. Follows the `useX(dependencies)` /
 * `useWiredX()` pair documented in `apps/admin/INFO.md`'s Hooks section.
 *
 * Both members are dependencies, not just the fetch. `subscribeToSettingsRefresh` is exactly what
 * `AssistantDock.unit.test.tsx` previously had to fight by partially un-mocking
 * `lib/settings-refresh-bus` (`vi.importActual`) — injecting it here means a test can drive a
 * refresh through the fake instead. Narrowed to a plain no-argument `listener`, not the raw
 * `(scope) => void` shape the real bus delivers: whether a given refresh notification is actually
 * about `core.language` is a fact only the real binding needs to compute (see
 * `admin-locale-dependencies.hooks.ts`'s `refreshApplies`) — matching `theme-pages-port.hooks.ts`'s
 * own "narrowed to the one field this hook reads" precedent.
