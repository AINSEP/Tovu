/**
 * @file Static comment-hygiene regression test for `styles/see-more.css`.
 *
 * This suite runs under `environment: "jsdom"` with `css: false` (see `vitest.config.ts`) — CSS
 * imports are stubbed to nothing, and jsdom has no layout engine regardless, so nothing under
 * `components/__tests__/SeeMore.unit.test.tsx` can observe whether the clamp actually applies (its
 * own header says so explicitly). That is a real, unfixable gap for the *layout* claim.
 *
 * The specific bug this file regressions-tests is different in kind and IS observable without a
 * browser: `see-more.css` once had a documentation comment whose second paragraph was missing its
 * opening delimiter, which left it as bare text sitting directly in front of the
 * `.see-more .see-more-text {` selector. A CSS parser collects all component values up to the next
 * top-level `{` as one rule's prelude — so that stray paragraph (plus its own trailing, and by then
 * meaningless, closing delimiter) got fused onto the real selector into one unparseable prelude,
 * and per CSS's error-recovery rules the *entire* qualified rule — selector and declaration block
 * together — was silently dropped. No console error, no HMR warning: the browser simply never saw
 * `display: -webkit-box` or `-webkit-line-clamp` at all. Confirmed live via
 * `document.styleSheets`: the served sheet had 4 rules instead of 5, with `.see-more .see-more-text`
 * entirely absent.
 *
 * `stripWellFormedComments` models exactly the part of the CSS tokenizer this bug depends on: only
 * an opening delimiter that is not already inside a comment starts one, and only a matching closing
 * delimiter ends it — a closing delimiter with no open comment has no special meaning and is
 * ordinary content, exactly as a real parser treats it. Extracting rule preludes the same way a
 * parser does (text between `}` and the next `{`) turns "a rule silently vanished" into a plain
 * string assertion, which is what `toContain(".see-more .see-more-text")` checks below: if a
 * comment ever goes unbalanced again and fuses prose onto this selector, the exact string stops
 * appearing in the prelude list and this test fails — for the same reason the browser would drop
 * the rule.
