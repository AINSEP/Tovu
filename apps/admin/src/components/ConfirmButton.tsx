/**
 * @file Shared two-click, in-place confirmation control for destructive or access-affecting
 * actions — cross-cutting audit finding #1 in
 * `ADS-memory/reports/audits/20260801-admin-adversarial-ux-audit.md`: "Confirmation coverage is a
 * coin flip." Roles.tsx (delete role, delete policy), Redirects.tsx (delete rule), and the
 * single-click Disable on Users.tsx/Members.tsx had no confirmation at all, while five other
 * screens each reinvented one independently. This generalizes the one in-place pattern already
 * proven in this codebase — `FormEditor.tsx`'s "Delete submission" -> "Confirm delete" — into a
 * component every screen can import instead of rebuilding.
 *
 * Chosen over a `window.confirm` wrapper or a `useConfirm()` hook that opens a shared modal:
 * `window.confirm` blocks the whole tab and cannot carry destructive-vs-warning styling or a
 * screen-reader-specific announcement; a modal needs new markup/CSS this pass cannot add
 * (`styles.css` is locked to a concurrently-editing agent — see the dispatch brief's file-lock
 * list). The in-place shape needs no new classes: it renders as an ordinary `<button>`, optionally
 * with the already-defined `.btn-danger`.
 *
 * Not a replacement for `Recovery.tsx`'s restore ceremony or `Collections.tsx`'s
 * `LifecycleConfirmDialog` — those stay their own heavier, purpose-built flows for operations with
 * more context to disclose than "are you sure". This is for the common case: a single row action
 * that was previously either bare or a native `window.confirm`.

 * announcing a text change inside a live-region-less `<button>`'s accessible name is inconsistent
 * across screen readers). Second click fires `onConfirm` and disarms immediately. Losing focus, an
 * outside click, or Escape disarms without firing, so a control armed and then abandoned (a slow
 * screen-reader read-through, a misclick landing elsewhere) cannot later be fired by an unrelated
