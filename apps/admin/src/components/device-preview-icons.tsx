 * @file Icons for the device-width preview toggle (`DevicePreview/DevicePreviewToggle.tsx`, shared by
 * the Pages, Posts and Themes editors over `DEVICE_PREVIEW_WIDTHS` — see that constant's doc). The toggle used to show the translated word
 * itself ("Desktop"/"Tablet"/"Mobile") as the button's visible text; the word is now icon-only
 * chrome — an `aria-label`/`title` carried by the caller from the same `t(entry.label)` call this
 * file has no opinion on — and these three glyphs are what replace it (2026-09-22 owner ask, device
 * icons over words).
 *
 * `@jini-ai/ui`'s own `Icon`/`IconName` set (`node_modules/@jini-ai/ui/dist/icon-name.d.ts`) has a
 * `smartphone` glyph but no laptop or tablet, and mixing one shared-library icon with two
 * hand-drawn ones would give the three buttons visibly different stroke weights and corner
 * rounding. All three are inline SVG here instead, sized and stroked identically (16px,
 * `stroke="currentColor"`, 1.5 stroke width) so the segmented control reads as one glyph set — the
 * same Lucide-derived convention `ThemeExplore.tsx`'s own fullscreen-trigger icon already uses
 * (`viewBox="0 0 24 24"`, `fill="none"`, `stroke="currentColor"`).
