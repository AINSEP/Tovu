/**
 * @file The three small pieces `SettingsUi.tsx`'s Execution tab and `AiAssistant.tsx`'s
 * `AdminExecutionMode` both mount around `ExecutionTab` for the admin's own BYOK credential — the
 * migration banner, the "Save key" footer, and the "Save settings" footer. Presentational only; all
 * state and API calls live in `hooks/use-admin-execution-credential.hooks.ts`, shared by both callers
 * so the two mounts render (and behave) identically rather than drifting — see that hook's own file
 * doc for why one shared implementation matters here specifically.
 *
 * `AdminByokKeyFooter`'s output is meant for `ExecutionTab`'s `apiKeyFooter` prop (directly under the
 * key field) and `AdminByokSettingsFooter`'s for its `formFooter` prop (the foot of the same card,
 * under Base URL / Max tokens / Model). Two slots because they are two buttons with two disjoint
 * jobs, and each belongs beside the fields it writes — see the hook's "One button per patch" doc.
 * `AdminByokMigrationPrompt` is a sibling of `<ExecutionTab>`, not a child of it — it has to render
 * regardless of whether BYOK mode is even selected, since an admin might be sitting in Local CLI mode
 * with a legacy key still inert in this browser's `localStorage`.
 *
 * All three take an optional pass-through `agentHandle` — the caller names the one thing
 * (`AdminByokMigrationPrompt`'s prompt, each footer's button), and the prompt derives its own
 * sub-handles from it via {@link byokAgentProps}. Omit and none renders any `data-agent-*` markup at
 * all.
