 * a 1131px pane rendering at the `880/1280` scale. React calls a callback ref exactly when the node
 * mounts, however late, and with `null` on unmount, so every mount gets a fresh observer and every
 * unmount disconnects it.

 * jsdom implements no `ResizeObserver` (`__tests__/setup.ts` deliberately leaves it unstubbed), so the
 * guard below keeps every unit test rendering at the `880` default.
