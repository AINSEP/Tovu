/**
 * @file `RoutedA2uiSurfaceCard`'s routing target, dismiss flag, and per-surfaceId error tracking,
 * split out of the component so it can be exercised directly (see the pure helpers' own coverage in
 * `use-routed-a2ui-surface-card.hooks.unit.test.tsx`) — the same split `SeeMore`/`SeeMore.hooks.tsx`
 * uses (and `ConfirmDialog`/`ConfirmDialog.hooks.tsx` in `@jini-ai/admin`): this file owns every
 * `useState`/`useRef`/`useSyncExternalStore` call, `RoutedA2uiSurfaceCard.tsx` stays
 * props-and-JSX only and calls {@link useRoutedA2uiSurfaceCard}.
 *
 * Lives in a `hooks/` subfolder (not a sibling `RoutedA2uiSurfaceCard.hooks.ts` file) per the
 * owner's `useWiredX` paradigm — `features/ai-assistant/hooks/` is the canonical shape, and this is
 * the first `components/*` directory carrying it; `SeeMore`, `MediaPickerDialog`, `InfoTip`,
 * `ImagePreviewModal`, and `AssistantDock` itself still use the older sibling-file shape.
 *
 * ## Why this hook has no `*Port`/`*Dependencies` pair and no `useWiredX` wrapper
 *
 * The `useX(dependencies)` / `useWiredX()` split exists to swap a REAL external dependency (an HTTP
 * client, a browser global that's awkward to drive in a test — see `usePresentMode`'s
 * `HtmlViewerDependencies` wrapping `document.fullscreenElement`/`requestFullscreen`/`window.open`
 * in `@jini-ai/ui`) for a fake one. This hook has no such dependency: `useSyncExternalStore`'s
 * subscribe/getSnapshot pair reads `playground-render-target-bus.ts`, a synchronous, in-memory,
 * already-a-plain-module store that ships its own direct test seam
 * (`setPlaygroundRenderTarget`/`resetPlaygroundRenderTargetBus`) — `RoutedA2uiSurfaceCard.unit
 * .test.tsx` already drives every branch of this hook that way, with no mock and no friction, the
 * same way `use-media-lightbox.hooks.ts`/`use-escape-to-cancel.hooks.ts` (both plain hooks, no port,
 * no wired pair) get driven directly. The rest of this hook's state (`dismissed`, the refused-
 * surfaceId tracking) is local component state, not I/O at all. Per this workspace's ratified rule —
 * "a hook doing NO I/O gets NO port; injection with nothing to inject is ceremony" — wrapping the bus
 * subscription in a manufactured port here would add a seam with nothing real on the other side of
 * it, so this file stays a plain exported hook.
