/**
 * @file `ui.spec.md` §1: brief, dismissible confirmation that a dropped folder is now the
 * workspace's readable `custom` fs-files root (SPEC-053, REQ-02). Renders only after the
 * `custom`-root call actually succeeds — never optimistically — per `ui.spec.md` §4; the caller
 * (`use-folder-drop.hooks.ts`) owns that timing, this component only renders what it is told.
 *
 * `autoDismissMs` (`ui.spec.md` §2.1) is intentionally NOT a prop here: `useFolderDrop` already owns
 * a single dismiss timer (`scheduleAutoDismiss`) as the one source of truth for when this notice
 * disappears. A second, component-local timer would risk two independent clocks disagreeing about
 * when to call `onDismiss` — a correctness footgun for a purely cosmetic feature, not a behavior a
 * duplicate timer buys back. The parent stops rendering this component (or unmounts) once its own
 * timer fires; there is nothing left for this component to time itself.
