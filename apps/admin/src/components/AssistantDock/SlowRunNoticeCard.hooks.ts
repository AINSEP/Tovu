/**
 * @file `SlowRunNoticeCard`'s two pure decision helpers, split out of the component (2026-09-05
 * Gemini audit finding 37) so the `.tsx` file stays props-and-JSX only, per this workspace's
 * standing "no functions or derived logic in a `.tsx` file" rule — the same split
 * `MessageOverflowModal`/`MessageOverflowModal.hooks.tsx` already uses one file over. Neither
 * helper below calls a React hook (no `useState`/`useEffect`/`useRef`) — both are plain, synchronous
 * derivations over already-available props — so this file exports functions directly rather than a
 * `useX` hook; `SlowRunNoticeCard.tsx` just calls them inline during render.
 *
 * Pure relocation only: neither helper's behavior changed by this move. See
 * `SlowRunNoticeCard.unit.test.tsx` for both helpers' coverage, carried over unchanged from when
 * they lived in the component file.

 * `runSucceeded`'s own contract is "ignored while `runStreaming` is true" (it is only meaningful once
 * the run is already terminal), so a naive `!runStreaming` check alone would already cover both
 * terminal outcomes (success and failure alike) correctly. This checks `runSucceeded` too, rather
 * than relying on that contract being honored upstream: if a caller ever reports `runSucceeded: true`
 * before `runStreaming` catches up to `false`, this still hides immediately instead of parroting a
 * stale "still working" for one more render.
 *
 * @param runStreaming - {@link ExtEventRenderProps.runStreaming}.
