/**
 * Whether a `ChatPane` `onSelectionChange` call is only `ChatPane` echoing back its own
 * normalization of the selection we passed in, not an operator pick.
 *
 * `ChatPane` resolves a controlled `selection` against its agent inventory and, when the resolved
 * value differs, reports it through `onSelectionChange` from an effect (`useChatPane.hooks.ts`):
 * a model-less `{ agentId: "claude" }` (the dock's starting value, and any hydrated agent with no
 * saved model) gains the agent's default model, an unavailable agent falls back to the first
 * available one. Every mount produced one such call, and persisting it wrote
 * `localCli.agentId`/`.model` on every admin page load (2026-09-23).
 *
 * With the inventory known, compare both values through `resolveChatPaneSelection`. A cached
 * inventory can still carry a legacy model alias that the picker no longer accepts; comparing
 * its raw model to the resolved current model misclassified an effort-only Default echo as a
 * pick, wrote Default, and blocked the next external effort refresh (2026-10-09). An
 * operator pick equal to it is also skipped, correctly: that value is what the picker already
 * shows. Without an inventory there is no echo to skip: `ChatPane` cannot normalize against an
 * empty list, and the dock records each live inventory (`recordAgents`) before `ChatPane` gets it.
 *
 * @param input.current - The selection the dock currently passes to `ChatPane`.
 * @param input.incoming - The value `ChatPane` reported.
 * @param input.agents - The inventory `ChatPane` resolves against, when known.
 * @returns `true` when `incoming` should be shown but not saved.
 * @complexity O(a + m + r) time and O(m) space for the resolver's inventory/model/effort scans.
 * @example isSelectionNormalizationEcho({ current, incoming, agents });
