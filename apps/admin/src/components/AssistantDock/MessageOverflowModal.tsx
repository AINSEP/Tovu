/**
 * @file The chat pane's "Show in modal" surface (owner request, chat-overflow fix 2026-08-30):
 * *"if we have a UI element that we can't really show in the chat very well, I want to have a
 * 'show in modal' button that brings up a modal and shows the whole table / the whole UI."*
 *
 * Built on the native `<dialog>` element (`showModal()`/`close()`), the same foundation
 * `ImagePreviewModal.tsx` already uses in this app and `@jini-ai/admin/react`'s `ConfirmDialog`
 * uses upstream — reusing the established dialog PATTERN rather than inventing a second one, per
 * this feature's own review note ("do not introduce a new dialog pattern"). Not built on
 * `ImagePreviewModal` or `ConfirmDialog` directly: both have a fixed content shape (an `<img>`; a
 * title+body+two-button confirm/cancel pair) neither of which fits "arbitrary chat content at full
 * size" — same reasoning `ImagePreviewModal.tsx`'s own doc gives for not forcing image content
 * through `ConfirmDialog`'s contract. `children` here is a plain `ReactNode` on purpose, so any
 * host content — the re-rendered markdown text, a second `McpUiSurfaceCard` instance, a future
 * content type — can be shown full-size without this component needing to know its shape.
 *
 * A generic host-agnostic modal (not `@jini-ai/chat`'s own component) because the injection point
 * for it differs by content type: `OverflowAwareMcpUiSurfaceCard.tsx` renders one directly, and any
 * future per-message-content affordance (see that file's own doc for why plain markdown text isn't
 * wired up yet) would render one the same way.
