/**
 * @file Renders the composer's pinned-Agent-Plugin chips — the visible, removable effect of
 * selecting the "UI/UX Design (Agent Plugin)" composer row (`composer-capabilities.ts`'s
 * `pluginRefId` field), replacing that row's previous `insertText` behavior (typing an inert
 * label string into the draft).
 *
 * Passed to `ChatPane` as `composerSlots.leadingAccessories` (`AssistantDock.tsx`) — the SAME slot
 * `@jini-ai/chat/react`'s own `Composer` already renders host content through, right above its
 * built-in attachment tray (`Composer.tsx`'s `slots?.leadingAccessories ? <div
 * className="jini-composer-leading">...` wrapper). No change to Jini's package was needed or
 * made: `AttachmentTray` (the package's own removable-chip component) is not part of its public
 * export surface (`react/index.ts`'s header: "every export here is explicit... do not
 * reintroduce `export *`"), and its props are typed against `ChatAttachment` specifically
 * (`path`/`name`/`kind`/`size`) — a plugin ref has none of those, so a new export purely to
 * satisfy one caller was judged a bigger footprint on a separate repo/package than a same-pattern
 * component living where the data it renders (this dock's own `useSelectedAgentPlugins` state)
 * already lives. This component instead reuses the package's own injected default stylesheet by
 * class name — `.jini-attachment-tray`/`.jini-attachment-chip`/`.jini-attachment-remove`
 * (`@jini-ai/chat`'s `features/chat-pane/styles.ts`, scoped under `.jini-chat-pane`) — so a pinned
 * plugin chip renders with the exact same box, spacing, and remove-button chrome an attachment
 * chip gets, with zero new CSS of its own. `Icon` (not `RemixIcon`) for the same reason: it is
 * `@jini-ai/chat`'s own `AttachmentTray` that uses the package-internal `Icon` component for its
 * remove button, and `@jini-ai/ui`'s `Icon`/`IconName` (unlike that internal one) is a public
 * export with the same `'close'` glyph — the one available way to match that exact icon without
 * reaching into the package's private component tree.
