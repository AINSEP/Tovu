 * canonical reference). This port is deliberately its own file rather than reusing
 * `features/media/hooks/media-port.hooks.ts`'s (larger) `MediaPort`: `components/` sits below
 * every feature and must not import from one (the same "nothing outside this feature needs it"
 * boundary `media-port.hooks.ts` itself states, just enforced in the other direction here) — a
 * reusable dialog depending on a specific feature's port would be a back-edge into the composition
 * root's dependency graph (see `project_tovu_architecture_metrics`). Scoped to the one route this
 * dialog actually calls.
 *
 * `describeApiError` stays a direct import in the hook — pure error-classification, no I/O, same
 * reasoning as `redirects-port.hooks.ts`'s own exclusion of it.

   * implementation): `media-picker-dependencies.hooks.ts` becomes the only file under this folder
   * that reaches `lib/api` for it, and a test can assert a rendered thumbnail's `src` came from the
   * injected port rather than `MediaPickerDialog.tsx` calling `api.mediaOriginalUrl` itself. See
   * `lib/api.ts`'s own `mediaOriginalUrl` for the exact URL shape this mirrors.
