 * @file What `use-dashboard.hooks.ts` needs from the outside world, as an interface rather than a

 *
 * Follows the `useX(dependencies)` / `useWiredX()` pair documented in
 * `development/docs/architecture/wired-hooks-convention.md` (canonical spec) and
 * `redirects-port.hooks.ts` (canonical reference implementation): this file declares,
 * `dashboard-dependencies.hooks.ts` binds the real `api` client, and nothing else under
 * `features/dashboard` imports `lib/api`.
 *
 * `listMedia`/`listCommentsQueue`/`getPresentation` are narrowed to only the field this hook
 * actually reads off each response (an active-status flag, an items count, one theme id) — same
 * narrowing precedent `theme-pages-port.hooks.ts` uses for its own `getPresentation()` slice.
 * `listPosts`/`listPages` keep the full `AdminPost` shape: both the stat cards AND the merged
 * "Recently updated" activity list (`rules.ts`'s `mergeRecent`/`activityRowHref`) read several
 * fields off the same rows, the same "genuinely used in full" case `media-port.hooks.ts` names for
 * keeping `AdminMedia` unnarrowed.
