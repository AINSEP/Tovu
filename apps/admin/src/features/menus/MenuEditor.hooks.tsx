 * `<Name>.tsx`/`<Name>.hooks.tsx` extraction pattern (admin TSX-logic-sweep, 2026-09-05).
 * `MenuEditor.tsx`'s own state/API calls all live in `hooks/use-menu-editor.hooks.ts`; this is a
 * second, LOCAL hook for markup-adjacent interaction logic that hook has no reason to own — same
 * split `SitemapModal.hooks.tsx` uses for its own regenerate-then-refetch sequencing.
 *
 * `countDescendants` moves here too (rather than staying in `MenuEditor.tsx` and being imported
 * back, which would make the two files import each other): its one caller is
 * `useMenuItemRemove` below, so relocating both together avoids a cycle.
