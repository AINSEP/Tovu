 * No port: purely local UI state derived from a prop plus a `navigate()` call, so there is
 * nothing to inject a dependency for — `Media.tsx` takes this hook itself as an overridable prop
 * (`useMediaTabsHook`, defaulted to this hook) rather than through a `useWiredX()` pair, the same

 *
 * @param tabId - The `?tab=` query value from `panels.tsx`'s `media` route (`URLSearchParams.get`
 * returns `null` when the param is absent).
 * @returns Tab-bar state: the active tab id (resolved against `MEDIA_TABS`) and a setter that
 * writes the new id into the URL via `navigate(..., { replace: true })`, matching `Deployment`'s
 * own reasoning for `replace` — switching tabs should not grow the back-button history one entry
 * per click.
