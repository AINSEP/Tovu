 * @file `EditMediaModal`'s native `<dialog>` lifecycle — the metadata edit form used to render as
 * a full-width `.card` pushing the grid down (`Media.tsx`'s own header comment has the history);
 * owner ask (2026-09-07): reach it from an eye icon on the card instead, as a modal. This hook owns
 * exactly the open/close/backdrop/Escape mechanics, same shape as `ThemePageDetailsModal.hooks.ts`'s
 * `useThemePageDetailsModal` and `AssistantDock/MessageOverflowModal.hooks.tsx` — copied rather than
 * imported, same reasoning those two give each other: a future media-specific tweak (e.g. warning
 * on unsaved changes before backdrop-dismiss) should never silently change an unrelated table's
 * modal, and vice versa.
 *
 * Only one instance is ever mounted — `Media.tsx`'s `MediaLibraryPanel` renders exactly one
 * `<EditMediaModal>`, toggling only its `item` prop as the selection changes (`editingId`/
 * `editingItem` in `use-media.hooks.ts`), the same "controlled, never conditionally unmounted"
 * shape `ConfirmDialog`/`MediaLightbox`/`ThemePageDetailsModal` all use. The actual form content
 * (`EditMediaPanel`) still gets a `key={item.id}` from its caller so switching the edit target
 * remounts it and reseeds its draft — this hook has no opinion on that; it only opens and closes
 * the `<dialog>` box around whatever is currently keyed inside it.
