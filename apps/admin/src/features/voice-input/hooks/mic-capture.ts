/**
 * @file The one impure piece of this feature: actual microphone capture via the Web Audio API,
 * and the one call out to `VoiceInputPort.transcribe`. `use-push-to-talk.hooks.ts` takes this
 * behind an injectable `PushToTalkCapture` interface so its own orchestration (state transitions,
 * error handling, calling `onTranscript`) is testable against a fake — this file itself is not
 * unit-tested, since jsdom (this repo's test environment) has no real `getUserMedia`/`AudioContext`
 * to exercise. See this feature's handoff notes for exactly what was hand-verified instead.
 *
 * Uses `ScriptProcessorNode` rather than an `AudioWorklet`. It is the deprecated API, kept here
 * deliberately for this first cut: an `AudioWorklet` needs its processor module loaded from a
 * separate URL (`audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule(...)`), which this Vite-bundled admin app has
 * no existing convention for serving — solving that packaging question is a reasonable follow-up,
 * not a blocker for a working v1. `ScriptProcessorNode` still works in every browser Electron ships.
