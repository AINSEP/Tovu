/**
 * @file Everything the mic button renders, derived in one pure place so `PushToTalkMicButton.tsx`
 * stays declarative — this app's standing rule that no derived logic lives in a `.tsx` body.
 *
 * **Why the unavailable state renders at all.** The first cut of this feature rendered nothing
 * outside the desktop shell, on the reasoning that a disabled control "implies voice input almost
 * works". In practice a control that simply is not there reads as a missing feature and invites the
 * obvious follow-up question, so the button now renders disabled with the real reason attached. It
 * still renders nothing while the availability probe is in flight — that window is a few
 * milliseconds and flashing an unavailable state that immediately corrects itself is worse than
 * showing nothing.
