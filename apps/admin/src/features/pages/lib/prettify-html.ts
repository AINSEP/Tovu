/**
 * @file A small, dependency-free HTML pretty-printer for the Pages editor's "HTML" tab.
 *
 * The owner reported the HTML view had "regressed" from a formatted tree back to a wall of text.
 * Checked first (`git log`/repo-wide grep for `prettier`/`js-beautify`/`html-format`/`CodeMirror`,
 * across both Tovu and Jini): no HTML formatter has EVER existed anywhere in this codebase — the
 * only precedent is `packages/ui/src/features/html-editor/css.ts`'s `prettifyCss` in the Jini repo,
 * which formats the CSS half of GrapesJS's export and explicitly argues for a small hand-rolled
 * tokenizer over a real parser or a bundled `prettier` build for exactly this reason: the added
 * weight isn't warranted for a formatting-only pass, and no such dependency exists in either
 * `package.json` in this repo already. This function is that same argument applied to HTML instead
 * of CSS, built fresh in Tovu (not Jini) since the Pages screen is Tovu-only. So the report the
 * owner is remembering is not this codebase — build it anyway, since the request stands regardless.
 *
 * **Why the "wall of text" happens now specifically**: `development/scripts/
 * convert-legacy-doc-pages-to-html.ts` converted several Pages from Tiptap `doc` JSON to raw HTML
 * earlier the same session, and the renderer that produced that HTML emits zero inter-element
 * whitespace (`</h2><h2 id="...">`, `<p>...</p><p>...</p>`, directly concatenated). Hand-authored
 * page bodies with their own existing line breaks were never touched by this gap; only the
 * machine-generated ones show it.
 *
 * **The save-corruption risk, and how this function is constrained to avoid it**: `PageEditor.tsx`
 * wires this into a live, editable textarea, not a read-only viewer, so the formatted text an
 * operator sees IS what can end up saved once they start typing (see that file's own comment on the
 * `draftHtml`/`prevViewRef` wiring for the "view alone never dirties the page" half of that
 * decision). Whitespace injected purely for readability must therefore never change what a visitor
 * sees when the result is saved. This function is deliberately narrow to guarantee that:
 *
 * - It ONLY inserts a newline+indent at a boundary between two tags that were textually adjacent in
 *   the source (zero existing characters between them) AND are both members of {@link BLOCK_ELEMENTS}
 *   — ordinary block-level HTML tags (`div`, `p`, `h1`-`h6`, `li`, …). A whitespace-only text node
 *   between two such elements is not rendered by any browser (block/flex/grid layout all discard
 *   it), so this specific class of insertion is provably invisible once rendered, independent of
 *   which theme or CSS is applied — UNLESS a stylesheet overrides one of those tags to
 *   `display: inline` (rare for a structural tag; disclosed as a residual risk, not fixed here).
 * - It NEVER touches a text run, an inline element's boundary, or the inside of `<pre>`, `<script>`,
 *   `<style>`, or `<textarea>` (see {@link RAW_TEXT_ELEMENTS}) — those are copied through byte for
 *   byte. This is why `<p>Tovu is a content platform <strong>vibecoded</strong> alongside…</p>`
 *   comes out exactly as authored: nothing inside a paragraph's mixed text/inline content is ever a
 *   zero-gap tag-to-tag boundary, so the rule never fires there.
 * - Existing whitespace between two tags (hand-authored formatting) is left completely alone — the
 *   rule only fires on a literal zero-character gap, so already-readable markup is a no-op through
 *   this function.
 *
 * @complexity O(n) two passes over the input length (tokenize, then print) — no backtracking, no
 * recursive descent, no DOM construction.
 */

 * Deliberately excludes inline-level and inline-with-fallback tags (`span`, `a`, `strong`, `em`,
