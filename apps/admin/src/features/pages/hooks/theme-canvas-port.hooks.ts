 * Like `features/posts`' `post-template-port.hooks.ts` — and unlike most ports in this app — the real
 * implementation wraps the browser's global `fetch`, not `lib/api`'s `api` client: a theme's token
 * files are served as static assets under `/theme-assets/{themeId}/tokens.json`
 * (`theme-static-assets.ts`'s `express.static` mount, proxied through Vite in dev by
 * `apps/admin/vite.config.ts`), outside the JSON API entirely.
