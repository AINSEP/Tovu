 * @file The Pages screen's `?tab=` deep link — mirrors `features/themes/hooks/theme-explore-
 * url.hooks.ts`'s split (own file, plain `history.replaceState`, not this app's `navigate()`) for
 * the same reason: `Pages.tsx`'s `activeTab` is pure view-chrome state (owner ruling — see that
 * declaration's own comment in `Pages.tsx`), so this has nothing to do with data loading; it only
 * reads and writes the address bar.
 *
 * Owner ask (2026-08-30): `http://localhost:5173/admin/pages?tab=themes` should open directly on
 * the Theme Pages tab. The URL word is `themes` (plural, matching the tab's own visible label
 * "Theme Pages") rather than the internal tab id `"theme"` (singular — `Pages.tsx`'s `TabBar` `id`,
 * unchanged since it also names the `usePagesHook`/`useThemePagesHook` seam and every existing
 * test). Translating between the two spellings is this file's whole job, the same boundary
 * `theme-explore-url.hooks.ts` draws between `?page=`'s wire value and the internal file `path`.

 * exactly what already rendered before this param existed, for every one of those same inputs, so
 * an unrecognized value falls back to the same place absence always did rather than guessing at a
 * closest match or leaving neither tab selected.
 *
