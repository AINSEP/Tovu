/**
 * @file What `use-theme-pages.hooks.ts` needs from the outside world, as an interface rather than a
 * direct `lib/api` import. Follows the `useX(dependencies)` / `useWiredX()` pair documented in
 * `development/docs/architecture/wired-hooks-convention.md`.
 *
 * 2026-08-30 (deep-link/publish-toggle pass): this port grew from one route (`getPresentation`) to
 * three. The Theme Pages tab used to show every `activeThemeStaticPageIds` entry with no publish
 * state and no way to tell a real page apart from `index`/`404`/a declared Post-or-Page template
 * shell — `getPresentation()` alone has neither fact (`presentation/get.ts`'s own
 * `activeThemeStaticPageIds` is a bare `Object.keys(activeTheme.pages)`, unfiltered). Both already
 * exist on the SAME route Theme Studio's Explore screen uses (`getThemeDetail`'s per-file
 * `published: boolean | null`, straight from the server's `isStandaloneThemePage`) — so this port
 * adds `getThemeDetail` and `setPagePublished` rather than a new server endpoint. `getPresentation`
 * stays, narrowed to just `settings.activeThemeId` now — `activeThemeStaticPageIds` itself is no
 * longer read anywhere in this feature, superseded by `getThemeDetail`'s richer `files` list, which
 * is the active theme's page ids PLUS the two facts this tab was previously missing.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT importing `ThemeExplorePort`'s identical-looking `getThemeDetail`/
 * `setPagePublished` shapes from `features/themes/hooks/theme-explore-port.hooks.ts` — same
 * "NOT shared with `themes-port.hooks.ts`" reasoning this file's own header already gave: each
 * feature's port independently declares the narrow slice of the wire contract it actually reads,
 * so two features touching the same two ROUTES is not a reason to couple them through one shared
 * type either. This screen only ever READS publish state and flips one boolean; a change to Theme
 * Explore's own port for ITS editing needs (rename, copy, delete, save) should never have to touch
 * this file at all.
