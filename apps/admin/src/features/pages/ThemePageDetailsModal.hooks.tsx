 * `ImagePreviewModal.hooks.tsx`: a future chat-pane-specific tweak to that hook should never
 * silently change this unrelated admin-table modal's behavior too, and vice versa.

 * Only one instance of this modal is ever mounted at a time — `ThemePagesTab.tsx` keeps a single
 * `detailPageId` state and renders exactly one `<ThemePageDetailsModal>`, never one per row — so
 * there is no risk of the double-mount shape a per-row modal would have needed to avoid.
