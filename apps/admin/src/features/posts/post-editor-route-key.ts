/**
 * @file Keeps the post editor mounted when its own save renames the slug in the URL.
 *
 * Since `0e8ca8ac7` an untitled post's slug follows its title until first publish, so the first save
 * usually moves the post from `/posts/untitled-6` to `/posts/my-title`. The editor replace-navigates
 * to the new slug so a reload, a new tab, or a shared link still finds the post — the old slug 404s.
 * `panels.tsx` keys `<PostEditor>` by the URL segment (a remount per record — see the comment there),
 * so without this the rename would remount the editor right after the save: the "Saved" message,
 * undo history and anything typed while the save was in flight would be thrown away. A rename records
 * `to → key of from`, so the panel keeps the same key for the same record.
 *
 * A new post's working copy has the empty segment (`?create=1`). Each one gets its own draft key, kept
 * through its first Save and then retired, so the next new post gets another. One shared key let two
 * new posts reuse a single editor: after saving A then B, navigating A→B kept A on screen under B's URL
 * (review 2026-11-02).
