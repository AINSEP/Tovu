/**
 * @file Everything the Dockerfile tab does — load, edit, save, and the copy-to-clipboard
 * interaction — so `DockerfileTab.tsx` is only markup.
 *
 * ## 2026-08-15 — the tab gained a write half
 *
 * The backend (`PUT .../system/dockerfile`, `api.setDockerfileSource`,
 * `features/deployments/dockerfile.ts`'s `writeDockerfileSource`) landed the same day as this
 * change and was already wired through `dockerfile-source-port.hooks.ts`/
 * `dockerfile-source-dependencies.hooks.ts` before this hook touched it — see those files' own
 * headers. `DockerfileTab.tsx`'s OWN header used to claim "there is no write route" as the reason
 * this tab was read-only; that had gone stale (the write route existed, the frontend just hadn't
 * been wired to it yet) and is corrected as part of this pass, not left standing.
 *
 * `snapshot`/`draft` are deliberately two different pieces of state, not one: `snapshot` is the
 * last value this hook knows the SERVER holds (from the initial load, or echoed back by a
 * successful save); `draft` is the operator's live edit buffer, seeded from `snapshot` once and
 * otherwise touched only by `setDraft`/a successful `save()`. Same split `use-form-editor.hooks.ts`
 * draws between `list.data` and `form`/`name`/`slug`/etc., and for the identical reason: an
 * in-progress edit must survive a background refresh of the same query key without being clobbered
 * (see `seededRef` below).
 *
 * `save()` calls `setDockerfileSource` through `useFetchMutation` with NO `invalidates` — there is
 * no sibling list resource for a single repo-root file, and the mutation's own response is a fresher
 * answer than a redundant re-`GET` of the same key would be. `snapshot`/`draft` are set directly
 * from that response instead, mirroring `use-form-editor.hooks.ts`'s `handleSave` (which invalidates
 * only the sibling `KEYS.list`, never its own `KEYS.form(id)` read) and
 * `use-widget-region-editor.hooks.ts`'s `save()` (though that one DOES re-`load()`, for a reason
 * that does not apply here — it reconciles a version counter for OTHER placements that may have
 * changed shape; a Dockerfile write has no analogous server-side transform to reconcile).
 *
 * ## 2026-08-15 — optimistic concurrency (Terra audit finding C5)
 *
 * `snapshot.etag` (from `AdminDockerfileSource.etag`, itself read off the server's `ETag` response
 * header — see that field's own doc in `lib/api.ts`) is sent as `save()`'s `ifMatch`, so a save that
 * is based on stale contents — e.g. the AI assistant's own `deployment_set_dockerfile` tool saved a
 * different version in between this hook's last load and this `save()` call — is refused by the
 * server (`412`) instead of silently overwriting it. On that refusal, {@link save} does the opposite
 * of every other failure path here: it does NOT let the generic `saveError` machinery describe it,
 * and it does NOT touch `draft` at all. Instead it populates {@link saveConflict} with the real
 * current contents the `412` response carried, so `DockerfileTab.tsx` can show them next to the
 * operator's own untouched `draft` for a side-by-side comparison — "a generic save error" is
 * explicitly the thing this is not (the brief for this change named that distinction directly).
 * {@link reloadAfterConflict} is the operator's way out: a fresh `GET`, replacing `snapshot` (and
 * therefore the etag the NEXT `save()` will use) with the server's current state, while still
 * leaving `draft` alone — the operator reconciles their own edit by hand against what
 * {@link saveConflict} showed them, then saves again.
