/**
 * @file Dockerfile tab — the repo-root `Dockerfile`'s contents, fetched from and now also written to
 * `.../system/dockerfile` (`src/server/routes/admin/system/dockerfile-source.ts`).
 *
 * ## Third pass (2026-08-15) — read-only became editable
 *
 * This file's own header used to say "Read-only on purpose: there is no write route" as the reason
 * this tab could never save an edit. That stopped being true the same day, mid-session: the backend
 * gained `PUT .../system/dockerfile` (`system.write`-gated, distinct from `GET`'s `system.read`) so
 * that both a human here and the `deployment_set_dockerfile` agent tool can write the same file — but
 * only the agent side got wired up at first. The AI assistant could edit the Dockerfile through its
 * tool; the human owner, looking at this exact screen, could not. This pass closes that gap: the
 * `<pre><code>` viewer is now a `<textarea>` bound to `useDockerfileSource`'s `draft`, with a Save
 * button next to Copy/Download.
 *
 * The "no Dockerfile yet" empty state gained the same editor rather than staying a dead end — the
 * write route creates the file if it doesn't exist (`writeDockerfileSource`'s own doc), so a human
 * typing a fresh Dockerfile into this screen and clicking Save is exactly as valid as the agent tool
 * calling `deployment_set_dockerfile` on a workspace with no Dockerfile yet. The illustrated
 * "Not generated yet" block from the second pass stays exactly as it was, ahead of the editor, rather
 * than being replaced by it — this tab still owes the reader an honest "this doesn't exist yet"
 * before handing them a blank box to fill in.
 *
 * ## Fourth pass (2026-08-15, same day) — a save conflict gets its own surface, not a generic error
 *
 * `useDockerfileSource`'s `save()` now sends `snapshot`'s etag as `If-Match`, so a save based on
 * stale contents (a human here and the AI assistant's `deployment_set_dockerfile` tool can both
 * write this same file — Terra audit finding C5) is refused rather than silently overwriting the
 * other write. That refusal reaches this component as `saveConflict`, deliberately kept separate
 * from `saveError` (see `use-dockerfile-source.hooks.ts`'s own header) — `DockerfileEditorCard`
 * below renders it as its OWN block, ahead of (and instead of) the plain error paragraph, showing
 * the real current server contents next to the operator's still-untouched `draft` and a button that
 * calls `reloadAfterConflict` to refresh `snapshot`'s etag without discarding that draft.
 *
 * Saving does not build, validate, or deploy anything — same as before, just now said twice: once in
 * the pre-existing "Building is a terminal command…" footer line (still true, still there), and once
 * in a new second line that names the Save button specifically, since a reader who has just watched
 * this tab grow a Save button has a new, reasonable reason to wonder whether it also rebuilds.
 *
 * `useDirtyGuard` is wired for the one form of "leaving with unsaved changes" this tab can protect
 * against on its own — closing or reloading the browser tab (`beforeunload`). It is deliberately NOT
 * wired to `TabBar`'s own tab-switch or to sidebar navigation: `Deployment.tsx`'s `deploymentTabPanel`
 * unmounts this component when the operator switches to another of the five tabs, same as leaving any
 * other screen in this admin, and NO editor screen in this app guards THAT kind of navigation today
 * (only in-app "back" links some screens wire individually) — extending that pattern app-wide is a
 * separate, larger decision than "make this one tab editable."
