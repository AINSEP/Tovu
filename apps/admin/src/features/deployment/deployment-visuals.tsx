/**
 * @file The Deployment panel's own small presentational pieces — four inline icons and the
 * capability list they sit above. No hooks, no fetch, no data of its own.
 *
 * Icons are inline SVG at `currentColor` rather than an icon dependency: this app ships no icon
 * component library to `features/` (the sidebar's own glyphs are inline SVG in `App.tsx`, and
 * `SettingsUi.tsx`'s tab icons are inline SVG too), so following that is reuse, not reinvention.
 * All four are `aria-hidden` — every one of them sits next to text that already says the same
 * thing, and an icon that duplicates its own label is noise to a screen reader
 * (`frontend-accessibility`: "do not add `aria-label` to elements that already have visible text").
 * The one exception is {@link CapabilityMark}, whose ✓/✗ carries meaning the row's label does NOT
 * repeat, so it gets a real accessible name.
 *
 * Sizes are `1em`-relative where the icon sits inline with text, so they track the type scale
 * instead of pinning a px size that drifts when the surrounding text changes
 * (`kole-jain-uiux-concepts`: "size icons to match the related text line height").

 * problem the reset was avoiding. This one sits at the END, beside a visible text label that says
