/**
 * @file `Analytics` — markup-only screen. Every state below is driven through the injectable
 * `useAnalyticsHook` prop (see `Posts.tsx`'s own doc for the convention), never a fake `fetch`:
 * the whole point of the hook seam is that this screen's states (loading, error, empty, populated)
 * are reachable without a `DataTable` render depending on a real request settling.
 *
 * `t` (2026-08-11, standing i18n rule): `Analytics` now reads `t` off the injected hook rather than
 * calling `useAdminLocale()`/`analytics-i18n` itself, so `stubHook` supplies the identity translator
 * — every assertion below matches on the raw English key, stable against future copy/locale
 * changes, matching `wired-hooks-convention.md`'s own `t: (k) => k` example.
