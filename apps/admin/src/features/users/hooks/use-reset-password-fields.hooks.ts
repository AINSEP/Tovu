 * reopen of the SAME user (e.g. Cancel, then "Reset password" again from the row menu) still
 * resets even if the `users` list query happens to hand back the same object reference. This is
 * also why closing the dialog (`principalId` going back to `null`) resets these fields too: there
 * is no user-visible difference between "reset on close" and "reset on open" for a dialog that is
 * unmounted-in-effect (`ConfirmDialog` stays in the DOM but hidden) between the two.
 *
 * @param input - `resetPasswordFor` (open/closed + which user) and the sibling `newPassword` value.
 * @returns The confirm field's value/setter, the derived `mismatch` flag, and both reveal toggles.
 * @complexity Time/space: O(1) — fixed number of state cells, no iteration.
