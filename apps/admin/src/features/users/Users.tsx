/**
 * @file Admin "Users" screen (SPEC-006 §3 human grant-writing transitions + 0.6.0 CRUD-completion
 * amendment) — markup only.
 *
 * State and API calls live in `hooks/use-users.hooks.ts`; the row-menu logic and the
 * server-error-message overrides live in `rules.ts`. What stays here is what actually renders: the
 * form, the table, and the two dialogs.
 *
 * Mirrors `features/integrations/Integrations.tsx`'s fetch/loading/error/form/table shape.
 * Lists operator users, creates new ones (`CREATE_USER`), and grants roles/
 * policies to an existing user (`ASSIGN_ROLE`/`ATTACH_POLICY`) via an
 * inline expandable "Manage" row. Role/policy *creation* is out of
 * this screen's UI (no `CREATE_ROLE`/`CREATE_POLICY` form here) — the API
 * client exposes `api.createRole`/`api.createPolicy` for the Roles &
 * Permissions screen to reuse.
 *
 * 0.6.0: the same expandable row also carries `UPDATE_USER` (email),
 * `RESET_USER_PASSWORD`, and a quick `DISABLE_PRINCIPAL`/`ENABLE_PRINCIPAL` toggle.
 *
 * Row actions (audit follow-up): all three of the above — Disable/Enable, Manage (opens the
 * expandable row), Reset password — now live behind a single three-dot `RowMenu`, matching
 * `Posts.tsx`/`Pages.tsx`'s row-action shape rather than a row of separate buttons.
 *
 * Delete-user plan v2 (2026-09-24): a fourth "Delete" item joins the menu, shown only when the
 * signed-in caller may manage the user Trash (owner or the built-in `admin` role — OWNER DECISION
 * 2026-09-24, `use-users.hooks.ts`'s `canManageUserTrash`). It moves the target to the Trash
 * (disabled, sessions revoked, restorable there for 60 days) rather than hard-deleting it — see
 * `UserDeleteDialog`'s own doc comment.
 *
 * Complexity-ceiling pass (2026-08-06): `Users` and its row-map closure both scored over the
 * ceiling (19/16 and 11/11 respectively). Split into four top-level, individually-testable
 * functions below — `NewUserForm`, `UsersTable`/`UserRow`, `UserDisableDialog`/`UserDeleteDialog`,
 * `UserResetPasswordDialog` — following `Taxonomy.tsx`'s existing convention of sibling top-level
 * function components in the same file rather than nested closures (a nested `const` inside
 * `Users` would not have moved any branching out of `Users`' own scope). `Users` itself is now a
 * thin composition of those, none of them exported, so no test does anything `Users.tsx`
 * didn't already support — see `__tests__/Users.unit.test.tsx`/`Users.crud.unit.test.tsx` for the
 * full-render tests these were extracted underneath (unchanged), plus new
 * `__tests__/users-components.unit.test.tsx` for direct component-level tests of each piece.
 *
 * Reset-password confirm + reveal (typo-catching pass): `UserResetPasswordDialog` gained a second
 * field ("Confirm new password") and an independent show/hide toggle per field, both driven by the
 * new `hooks/use-reset-password-fields.hooks.ts` (confirm-field state and both reveal flags are
 * purely local/ephemeral — never sent to the server, so they don't belong in `use-users.hooks.ts`'s
 * screen-wide `UsersController`). The confirm-vs-server-error display conflict is resolved by giving
 * the two states one shared slot with a fixed precedence — a live mismatch always wins over a stale
 * `passwordError` from a previous attempt — rather than trying to show both at once or inventing a
 * second error line; see `UserResetPasswordDialog`'s own body for the exact ternary. `RevealablePasswordField`
 * is the shared field+toggle shape both new inputs use, following this file's own `GrantSelect`
 * precedent for a shape used twice.
