 * testable.
 *
 * Moved here from `Users.tsx`: the screen's own `describeApiError` override (a branch per server
 * error `code`), the row-menu item builder (a branch on `user.status` plus the confirm-vs-immediate
 * split for Disable/Enable), and the role/policy grant label formatter (a branch on whether the
 * user holds any grants of that kind). All three were previously closures or free functions inside
 * the component, reachable only by rendering the full screen.
 *
 * `KEYS` (fetch-query migration, 2026-08-12): one identity for the combined users+roles+policies
 * read — matches the pre-migration `reload()`, which always refetched all three together.

 *  cognitive score (11 -> under the ceiling): the codes are a closed set of *literal string* keys,
 *  not a discriminated union, so there is no TypeScript exhaustiveness to lose by using a table
 *  (contrast `translateRunAgentPayload`'s `switch`, which stays a `switch` for exactly that reason).

 * only when `canDelete` is true. The server gate (owner or the built-in `admin` role,
 * `delete-user-service.ts`'s `callerMayManageUserTrash`) is the real boundary; `canDelete` is this
 * row's own affordance-hiding mirror of it, computed once per render from `/auth/me` by
 * `use-users.hooks.ts` — see that hook's `canManageUserTrash` state for where it comes from.
 *
 * Disable/Enable share a single "toggle" item (label follows status, same shape as
 * `Redirects.tsx`'s own toggle item) — Disable confirms via the modal below; Enable fires
 * immediately, matching this screen's existing behavior (Enable was never confirm-gated). The
 * `toggleSaving` guard reproduces the original inline check (`if (toggleSavingId) return`) against
 * whatever row action is currently in flight, read fresh at click time.
 *
 * "Manage" always reads "Manage", never "Close": the item still toggles the expanded panel
 * (`onManage` — closing it again by selecting "Manage" a second time still works exactly as it did
 * as a standalone button), but a `RowMenu` item disappears the instant it is selected, so a label
 * that flips to "Close" is never actually visible mid-interaction — it would only ever describe a
 * state the operator cannot see while the menu that shows it is open. A static label sidesteps that
 * without losing any capability.
 *
 * "Delete" always opens the confirm dialog (`onRequestDelete`), matching Disable's shape rather than
 * Enable's immediate-fire one — see `UserRowMenuHandlers.onRequestDelete`'s own doc comment.
 *
 * @complexity Time/space: O(1) — at most four entries, no iteration.
