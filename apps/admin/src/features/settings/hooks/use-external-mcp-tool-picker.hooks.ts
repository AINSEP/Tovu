/**
 * @file The transport and draft state behind `ExternalMcpToolPicker` — the `useX(deps)` /
 * `useWiredX()` pair this app uses everywhere, so the component composes the real port and a test
 * composes a plain fake (`use-external-mcp-admissions.hooks.ts` is the sibling precedent).
 *
 * ## The probe is gesture-gated, and that is a requirement rather than an optimisation
 *
 * `POST .../mcp-servers/:serverId/probe` (C-007) opens a real outbound MCP session on the operator's
 * own credentials and is rate-limited in front of its guard — the outline's W-001 records it as
 * "not idempotent (outbound call)". Probing every configured server on mount would therefore fire
 * one live third-party handshake per card every time anyone opened Settings. `enabled` keeps the
 * read gated on the operator actually opening this server's Tools tab, and `staleTime` keeps a tab
 * switch from re-probing a surface that has not changed.
 *
 * It is still a `useFetchQuery` rather than a `useFetchMutation` despite the POST: what it returns
 * is a READ of the vendor's advertised surface, it is cached per server, and the operator needs an
 * explicit re-read affordance (`refetch`) — all three of which are query semantics. The POST is a
 * transport detail of the route, not a statement that this call changes anything of ours. D-3 keeps
 * it out of the database entirely, so this cache is the only place a probe result lives.
 *
 * ## Why the draft is re-seeded from a signature rather than from object identity
 *
 * The panel re-renders on every roster poll, and an effect keyed on the probe's `tools` array or on
 * the row objects would re-seed the draft — silently discarding an operator's half-finished
 * selection across a 101-row list. {@link toolSurfaceSignature} reduces the inputs to the only thing
 * that should cause a re-seed: a genuinely different advertised surface, or a genuinely different
 * saved value. Re-rendering with the same server state leaves the draft alone.
