/**
 * @file `resolveSchemaStateWarning` — the pure decision behind the Database screen's drift warning.
 *
 * The whole reason this warning exists is that `db/drift.ts`'s classification had no human-facing
 * surface. So the property that actually matters here is NEGATIVE and is asserted throughout: the
 * ONLY input that produces silence is a confirmed-clean `"in-sync"` read (plus the pre-first-read
 * loading state, where nothing is claimed either way). Every other input — an unrecognised status,
 * a partial comparison, a failed request — must produce a visible "we could not confirm this",
 * never an absent banner that a site owner would read as "all good".
