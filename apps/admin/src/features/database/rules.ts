/**
 * @file Pure logic for the `database` feature — everything that computes a value rather than
 * rendering one. New file: this feature had no `rules.ts` before this migration, since none of its
 * three sections had computed logic worth extracting until `KEYS` needed a shared home.
 *
 * `KEYS` (fetch-query migration, 2026-08-12): `restorePoints` and `timeline` are two independent
 * resources — `use-restore-points-section.hooks.ts`'s create action never reloaded the timeline in
 * the pre-migration code either (each section owns its own load, no cross-invalidation), so they
 * get two entirely separate top-level namespaces rather than a shared grandparent, same shape
 * `forms/rules.ts`'s `KEYS` uses for `forms` vs `form-submissions`.
 *
 * `timeline(filters)` keys on the four filter fields together, not on a separate "applied" flag —
 * `use-timeline-section.hooks.ts` keeps a `kind`/`outcome`/`fromDate`/`toDate` DRAFT (bound to the
 * filter form's own inputs) separate from the `appliedFilters` state this key is built from, so
 * typing into a filter field does not itself trigger a reload — only `applyFilters` committing the
 * draft into `appliedFilters` does, matching the pre-migration `applyFilters`'s explicit
 * `load(true)` call. `use-migrate-forward-section.hooks.ts`'s plan/confirm/execute ceremony has no
 * read of its own to cache (no `KEYS` entry needed for the ceremony's own state), but its `execute`
 * step IS a write that changes two reads OTHER sections own — the drift banner's `schemaState` and
 * the Timeline's ledger — so it invalidates `KEYS.schemaState` and `KEYS.timelineAll` on success (see
 * that hook's own doc comment, and the 2026-09-20 platform-review fix for the bug this closes: the
 * banner and Timeline used to go stale after a migration with nothing to re-read them).

 * classification, which until now had no UI at all. Its governing rule is therefore negative — the
 * ONLY inputs that return `null` are a confirmed `"in-sync"` read and the pre-first-read state
 * (`state: null` with no error), where nothing has been claimed yet. Everything else returns a
 * visible banner, including inputs that represent ignorance rather than trouble. An absent banner
 * on this screen reads as "your database is fine", so anything less than a confirmed-clean answer
 * must not produce one. That is the same discipline `adapter.sqlite.ts` states server-side ("never
 * fabricated") carried through to the pixel.
 *
 * PRECEDENCE: `error` is checked before `state`, so a stale successful read cannot mask a check
 * that has just failed — a previous "in-sync" is not evidence about now.
 *
 * The `default` branch is deliberately reachable: `status` arrives as JSON off the wire, so its
 * TypeScript union is a claim about the server, not a runtime guarantee. A future status this
 * build has never heard of resolves to "could not check" rather than falling through to silence.
