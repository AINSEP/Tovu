/**
 * @file `FormSubmissions`'s own state and paginated load, so the submissions list in
 * `FormEditor.tsx` is only markup.
 *
 * Extracted verbatim — same cursor-append load shape, same error strings. `load` keeps its original
 * `(cursor?: string) => void` signature rather than being split into separate "load"/"loadMore"
 * functions, so both call sites (`load(nextCursor)` for "Load more", `load()` after a submission
 * delete) carry over unchanged.
 *
 * Naming follows `hooks/use-settings-slice.hooks.ts`: `use-<thing>.hooks.ts`. Feature-local because
 * nothing outside `features/forms` needs it.
 *
 * `port` is injected — see `form-submissions-port.hooks.ts` (shared with `use-form-submission-
 * detail.hooks.ts`, since both read/write the same submissions list for a form) — rather than
 * importing `lib/api` directly, so a test can describe list outcomes against
 * `createFakeFormSubmissionsPort` instead of stubbing global `fetch`. `useWiredFormSubmissions`
 * below is the zero-argument pair `FormEditor.tsx` actually mounts.
 *
 * `lib/fetch-query` migration (2026-08-12): the FIRST page is one `useFetchQuery` keyed on
 * `KEYS.submissionsList(formId)` — a query cannot commit a response belonging to a prior key, which
 * eliminates the load race an external audit flagged at this file's old line 56 (a plain
 * `.then()`/`.catch()` effect with no cancellation guard) for that page. Subsequent "Load more"
 * pages are NOT folded into that same query: `lib/fetch-query/types.ts`'s `QueryKey` doc binds one
 * hook to one FIXED key, and a cursor-appended page list is exactly the "moving-target key" shape
 * that doc's own Skip precedent (`useSettingsContainer`, see this migration's dispatch brief) warns
 * against faking — so accumulated pages stay local `useState`, fetched directly through `port`
 * (bypassing the cache, since an appended page is not a cacheable "the current state of X", it's an
 * accumulating view built by this one screen). `pageSettlement` (`useSettlementGeneration`) guards
 * that accumulation against the SAME class of race the base query gets for free: a `loadMore` in
 * flight when `formId` changes, or when a first-page refetch (e.g. a delete's invalidate) resets
 * the list, must not append its page once it resolves — see `resetMorePages` below, which mints a
 * fresh generation on every reset so any older in-flight page fetch is superseded. A synchronous
 * `loadingMoreRef` lock, checked before minting a generation, covers the other half: two `loadMore`
 * calls issued in the SAME tick (a double click) must send only one request
 * (2026-09-20, `plan-content2.md` #3/#5/S2).
 *
 * The audit's second, more serious finding at this file — `selectedId` surviving a `formId` change
 * untouched, so a delete could fire against a submission id belonging to the PREVIOUS form while its
 * stale rows were still on screen — is fixed by the identity-reset effect below, which clears both
 * `selectedId` and the accumulated "more" pages whenever `formId` changes.
