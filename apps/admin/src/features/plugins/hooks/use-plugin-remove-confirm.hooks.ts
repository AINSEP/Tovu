/**
 * @file `PluginRemoveConfirmDialog`'s three behaviours — Escape-to-cancel, the name-derived copy,
 * and (2026-09-20 platform review, Finding 4) the Tab focus trap — so the dialog component itself is
 * only markup. Mirrors `use-agent-plugin-disable-confirm.hooks.ts` (same split, same reason: `copy`
 * is a derived value, not something the component should compute inline) and
 * `features/settings/hooks/use-external-mcp-remove-confirm.hooks.ts` (the precedent both dialogs
 * follow for a genuinely destructive remove).
 *
 * Not sharing either of those hooks directly: each is feature-local by its own header's stated
 * convention, and duplicating an 8-line Escape effect here is cheaper than a cross-file import for
 * a third single-consumer hook — same call this directory's own sibling hook already made.
 *
 * Focus trap (Finding 4): this dialog declares `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"` but, until now, had
 * no actual Tab containment — the attribute told assistive technology everything behind the dialog
 * was unavailable while the browser let Tab walk straight out onto it. Wired through the shared
 * `useFocusTrap` primitive (`ebcda9aae`) here in the hook, not in the component body the way
 * `MediaEditDialog.tsx` does it — this admin's "logic belongs in hooks, not `.tsx`" rule, and this
 * dialog already has a paired hook to hold it. `dialogRef` is returned for the component to attach to
 * its `role="dialog"` div; `autoFocus` on Cancel is unaffected — the trap only redirects Tab once
 * focus is already somewhere inside the container, it never moves initial focus itself.
