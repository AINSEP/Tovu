/**
 * @file Confirmation gate in front of the SAME underlying operation from two different controls.
 * There is no admin uninstall route — the only two agent-plugins routes are `GET .../agent-plugins`
 * (list) and `PATCH .../agent-plugins/:pluginId` (set-enabled); `uninstallAgentPlugin()`
 * (`features/agent-plugins/uninstall.ts`) is reachable only from an assistant tool and refuses every
 * bundled package outright — see `AgentPluginRow`'s own header for why its trash icon is honestly
 * disabled for that reason. So "remove this plugin", mechanically, is what turning it off already
 * does: `resolveAgentPluginRefs()` refuses to pin a disabled plugin into a run, which is the only
 * lever an operator actually has over a bundled package. This dialog exists because that lever has a
 * real cost (the assistant loses those skills on its very next run) and, before it landed, a single
 * click fired that cost with no way to reconsider.
 *
 * Two `variant`s, same mechanism, added when Downloaded's row lost its Enable/Disable switch in
 * favor of a single Remove/Enable action (2026-09-09 — see `AgentPlugins.tsx`'s own header):
 *   - `"disable"` — Installed's switch. Confirm reads "Disable", matching the verb the switch itself
 *     already shows via the row's "Enabled"/"Disabled" word — the owner's explicit call against
 *     renaming that control to "Add to site / Remove from site".
 *   - `"remove"` — Downloaded's action button. Confirm reads "Remove" to match that button's own
 *     label; the body still discloses, honestly, that this can't delete anything the backend can't
 *     already refuse to delete — see `buildAgentPluginDisableConfirmCopy`'s own header.
 *
 * Enabling stays a plain one-click action in both places — see `AgentPlugins.tsx`'s own
 * `onRequestToggleEnabled`/`onRequestRemove` — because turning a plugin ON has no comparable cost to
 * interrupt: nothing an operator already depends on stops working.
 *
 * Markup, classes (`settings-dialog`/`settings-dialog-backdrop`, `btn-secondary`/`btn-danger`), and
 * behaviour (Escape-to-cancel via the paired hook, Cancel default-focused so the destructive-leaning
 * action is never the default) mirror `features/settings/ExternalMcpRemoveConfirmDialog.tsx` — the
 * most recent precedent for exactly this shape of dialog in this app, reused rather than
 * re-invented.
