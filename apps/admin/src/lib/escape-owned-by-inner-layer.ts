/**
 * @file Whether an Escape keypress belongs to an open inner layer (modal, menu, popup) rather than
 * to the container behind it.
 *
 * Every modal here closes on a document-level `keydown` listener (`useDismissOnOutsideOrEscape` in
 * `@jini-ai/ui`), and so does the assistant dock (`App.hooks.ts`). With the dock's Chat settings
 * modal open, one Escape therefore closed BOTH (Chrome check, 2026-10-11). The dock's Chats menu
 * (`ConversationList` in `@jini-ai/chat`) has the same shape: its own document listener closes it
 * without `preventDefault`, so Escape closed the menu AND the dock (Chrome re-check, 2026-10-11).
 * The dock asks this first and leaves the keypress to whichever layer is on top.
 *
 * Listener order does not matter: React batches the inner layer's `setOpen(false)` past the current
 * dispatch, so the open menu/modal is still in the DOM when the dock's listener reads it.
