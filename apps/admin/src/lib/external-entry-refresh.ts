/**
 * @file The pure "did this row change out from under an open editor, and what should happen" rule
 * shared by `use-page-editor.hooks.ts` and `use-post-editor.hooks.ts` (2026-09-16, owner bug: an
 * assistant tool writes a Page/Post while its editor is open, and nothing on screen updates until a
 * manual reload).
 *
 * `version` is the change signal because it is already the field every write path bumps
 * (`html-document-store.sqlite.ts`, `post.ts`) whether the write came from the operator's own Save
 * or an agent tool — no new column, no timestamp-skew risk, and a read-only tool result never
 * touches it, so a notification with an unchanged version is correctly a no-op rather than a
 * spurious refresh.
 *
 * `saving` outranks `dirty`: a save already in flight owns the next state transition (its own
 * success or its own 409 conflict banner). Applying a background read over it, or raising a
 * competing notice while it resolves, would either clobber the save's own outcome or double-prompt
 * the operator about the exact same version bump their own Save is about to produce.
