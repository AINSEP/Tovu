 * GETs (2026-09-23). Interface and execution slices also read outside the hook query cache.
 * Only the in-flight request is shared, never a settled value, so a later mount still reads the
 * server's current settings. Hook observers additionally share their query cache.

 * The host API supplies its authorized request port and full path, including workspace and optional
