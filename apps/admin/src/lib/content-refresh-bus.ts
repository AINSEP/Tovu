/**
 * @file The seam between "content changed somewhere else" and "the mounted content screens re-read
 * it", so an operator sees a taxonomy the assistant just created without reloading the page.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists for
 *
 * `taxonomy_create_taxonomy` is agent-callable. An operator with the Categories & Tags screen open
 * beside the assistant dock asks for a taxonomy, the chat says it was created, and the list beside
 * it keeps rendering what it fetched at mount. Ctrl-R is the only way to see the write land, which
 * reads as the tool having silently done nothing.
 *
 * ## Why a sibling of `settings-refresh-bus.ts` rather than a generalization of it
 *
 * The two are the same *shape* (a fire-and-forget name broadcast) but not the same *vocabulary*.
 * This one carries content resource names — `"taxonomy"` — and that one carries settings namespaces
 * — `"core.language"`. Folding them into one bus would put both vocabularies in one string space
 * with no way to tell them apart, so every settings slice would re-read on a taxonomy write and
 * every content screen on a language change. The `null` "unknown, refresh everything" case makes
 * that worse, not better: a merged bus's `null` means *both* vocabularies refresh.
 *
 * Extracting a shared `createRefreshBus()` factory would remove the duplicated listener-`Set`
 * boilerplate without merging the vocabularies, but it would mean editing a working
 * `settings-refresh-bus.ts` and its six live call sites for ~25 lines of savings. Note that the
 * other two buses in `lib/` (`assistant-dock-bus.ts`, `playground-render-target-bus.ts`) would NOT
 * be candidates for that factory — both hold state and expose a `getSnapshot` for
 * `useSyncExternalStore`, so this makes two instances of the fire-and-forget shape, not four. Two
 * is where the factory is still speculative.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT carry
 *
 * Only resource names — never rows, ids, or payloads. A subscriber re-reads through its own normal
 * authorized path (`useInvalidate()` on its own query key, which refetches through the same
 * `port`/`api` call it used at mount), so this bus can never become a channel that hands a
 * component data it would not have been allowed to fetch. That property is inherited deliberately
 * from `settings-refresh-bus.ts` and is what keeps a future SSE publisher simple: it never has to
 * reason about whether a payload is safe for this principal, because there is no payload.
