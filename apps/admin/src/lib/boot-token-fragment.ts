/**
 * @file The one-time `#boot=<token>` fragment a zip-launched Tovu opens the admin with (run-from-zip
 * plan, Q2/S2, `ADS-memory/.local-artifacts/run-from-zip-plan-2026-09-23.md:46,112-117`). The
 * launcher opens `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/admin/#boot=<token>`; `App.hooks.tsx`'s boot effect calls
 * {@link takeBootToken} once, on mount, to read the token and scrub it from the URL bar in the same
 * synchronous pass — before anything else in that effect runs, including the network call that
 * redeems it. No logic belongs in `App.hooks.tsx`'s `.tsx` sibling (memory
 * `component_logic_belongs_hooks`), so this pure helper is the one place that parses or mutates the
 * fragment.
 *
 * Security properties, each one load-bearing (plan's own "Warnings for writers" / Sign-in row):
 * - The token is read from `location.hash`, which the browser never sends to the server and never
 *   puts in a `Referer` header — unlike a query string, which both do.
 * - `history.replaceState` runs before this function returns, so the token spends at most one
 *   paint in the URL bar and is never pushed as its own history entry (a `pushState` or a real
 *   navigation would leave it in Back history forever).
 * - This module never logs the token and never returns it to anything but its one caller.
