/**
 * @file The seam between "a setting changed somewhere else" and "the mounted settings tabs re-read
 * it", so an operator sees a change they did not make in this component without reloading the page.
 *
 * ## Why a bus rather than props
 *
 * Two unrelated publishers need to reach the same subscribers, and neither is anywhere near them in
 * the tree:
 *
 * 1. `components/AssistantDock/AssistantDock.tsx` — an assistant run finished, and it may have called
 *    `settings_set_ui_preference`. The dock and `features/settings/SettingsUi.tsx` are siblings under
 *    `App.tsx` with no shared state between them.
 * 2. `lib/settings-events.ts` — the server pushed a change over SSE, which is how a write made in
 *    ANOTHER tab, by another operator, or by a background process arrives.
 *
 * Threading a callback from `App.tsx` through both subtrees would couple the assistant dock and the
 * transport layer to the settings panel's internals for what is, in both cases, a fire-and-forget
 * notification carrying no data.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does NOT carry
 *
 * Only namespace names — never values. A subscriber re-reads through the normal authorized
 * `getSettingsEffective` path, so the bus can never become a channel that hands a component a value
 * it would not have been allowed to fetch. That property is what lets the SSE publisher stay
 * simple: it never has to reason about whether a payload is safe for this principal, because there
 * is no payload.
