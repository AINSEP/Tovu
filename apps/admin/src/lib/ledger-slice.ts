/**
 * @file The shared read/diff-write half of every settings-dialog tab adapter.
 *
 * Each tab maps a SPEC-007 ledger namespace onto one `@jini-ai/ui` config
 * object. Three things are identical across all of them and live here:
 *
 * 1. **Cold-start tolerance.** A namespace with no registered definitions
 *    404s, which is the expected state before the boot registrar has run (or
 *    on a database predating the tab). That is not an error worth surfacing —
 *    it means "use defaults". Every OTHER failure still propagates.
 * 2. **Field-level diffing.** The ledger is append-only per key
 *    (ADR-028 §4), so writing all N keys on every save would burn N revisions
 *    per keystroke. Only changed keys are written.
 * 3. **Typed reads.** Ledger values arrive as `unknown`; a missing or
 *    wrong-typed value falls back field by field rather than throwing, so a
 *    partially-written namespace still yields a usable config.
 *
 * What deliberately does NOT live here: anything about a specific tab's
 * shape, and anything about credentials. `execution-settings.ts` keeps its own
 * localStorage half because the ADR-028 §6 secret gate is an execution-tab
 * problem, not a general one — see that file's header.
