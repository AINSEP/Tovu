/**
 * @file The `admin.capture_screenshot` executor — the assistant's only way to see the admin's actual
 * rendered pixels rather than DOM structure (`page.find_elements`).
 *
 * ## Wiring
 *
 * `App.hooks.tsx`'s `useAgentPageBridge` registers {@link renderAdminScreenshotCanvas} (indirectly,
 * through {@link captureAdminScreenshotToolResult}) under `createFrontendSessionBridge`'s
 * `executors: {"admin.": ...}` prefix map — the same host-extension seam that file's own module doc
 * describes `chat.*`/`page.*` claiming, just exercised here by a Tovu-native verb instead of a Jini
 * one. The capability id and description live server-side in
 * `apps/website/src/assistant/frontend-control-capabilities.ts`; {@link ADMIN_CAPTURE_SCREENSHOT_CAPABILITY_ID}
 * is duplicated here because apps/admin and apps/website are separate builds with no shared-types
 * package for this — the same cross-boundary-string discipline `assistant-transport.ts`'s
 * `frontendBindToken` envelope key already relies on. `agent-screenshot.unit.test.ts` pins the two
 * strings equal so they cannot silently drift.
 *
 * The tool result shape (`{content: [{type:'text', ...}, {type:'image', mimeType, data}]}`) is
 * `assistant_demo_image`'s already-proven typed-media envelope
 * (`apps/website/src/assistant/demo-image-tool.ts`), reused verbatim rather than inventing a second
 * one: the daemon's `extractResultMedia` (`@jini-ai/daemon`) recognizes this shape generically, on
 * ANY tool's raw output, and lifts its `image` blocks into the `tool_result.media` wire field that
 * `ToolCard` renders inline — regardless of which registration mechanism produced the result. This
 * capability's registration mechanism (`createFrontendCapabilityRegistrations`, projected from
 * `FrontendCapabilitySpec`) is different from `assistant_demo_image`'s
 * (`buildDomainRegistrations`), but both ultimately hand the SAME shape to the SAME generic
 * extraction step, which is what makes reusing the shape (rather than the registration mechanism)
 * the correct thing to reuse.
 *
 * ## Capture mechanism — why in-page rasterization, not a screen-share prompt or headless Chromium
 *
 * Three ways to get pixels out of a browser were considered:
 *
 * 1. **In-page DOM rasterization (`html2canvas-pro`) — chosen.** Runs over the SAME frontend-control
 *    channel already proven live, needs no OS-level permission prompt, and captures the operator's
 *    ACTUAL current view: scroll position, open panels, in-progress form edits. This is exactly the
 *    state a "does this look cramped/broken" question is about.
 *
 *    **Why the `-pro` fork, not plain `html2canvas`.** Confirmed live (Playwright, 2026-08-30) against
 *    the real admin dashboard: upstream `html2canvas@1.4.1` (unmaintained since ~2022) throws
 *    `Error: Attempting to parse an unsupported color function "oklch"` and aborts the ENTIRE capture
 *    the instant it walks any element using an `oklch()` color — which `apps/admin/src/styles.css`
 *    and several feature stylesheets (`source-control.css`, `media.css`, `select.css`,
 *    `access-tokens.css`) already do. This is not a fidelity gap like the ones below; it is a hard
 *    failure that would make every real capture throw on this app specifically. `html2canvas-pro`
 *    (actively maintained, API-compatible fork adding `oklch`/`lab`/`lch`/`color-mix` support) was
 *    verified against the same real DOM with the identical call and produced a valid
 *    996x804 JPEG (~41KB) with no errors — see this file's handoff notes for the full before/after.
 * 2. **`navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()`.** True pixels, but the browser prompts for
 *    permission on EVERY capture (no way to pre-authorize a screen-share session for a chat tool
 *    call) and, worse, would let the assistant capture the whole screen or another window/tab, not
 *    just this one admin tab — a strictly larger blast radius than option 1 for no fidelity gain on
 *    the actual use case. Disqualified: the owner's own ask was to REMOVE a manual step, and a
 *    permission dialog on every screenshot reintroduces exactly that friction.
 * 3. **Server-side headless Chromium against an authenticated URL.** True pixels and high fidelity,
 *    but it renders a FRESH page load — wrong scroll position, no open dialog, no in-progress edit,
 *    none of the state that made the operator ask in the first place. `site-evidence/browser-port.ts`
 *    (Tovu's own existing headless-browser adapter) already documents that Chromium may be entirely
 *    ABSENT from a self-hosted Tovu image, which would make this capability silently unavailable in
 *    exactly the deployments most likely to need it (an operator with no screenshot tool of their
 *    own). Reproducing the admin's authenticated, mid-edit tab state in a second browser process
 *    would also require re-deriving session/auth/route state server-side — a much larger and more
 *    fragile undertaking than option 1.
 *
 * ## What this capture CANNOT see — read before trusting an empty region
 *
 * - **Cross-origin iframes render BLANK.** This is the loud one: every MCP-UI surface the assistant
 *   itself has rendered is a sandboxed iframe (see `reference_mcp_ui_surface_agent_driveability`),
 *   so a rendered MCP-UI card is invisible in this capture. A blank rectangle where a card should be
 *   is NOT evidence that nothing rendered.
 * - Cross-origin `<img>` elements without permissive CORS headers taint the canvas and render blank.
 * - `<canvas>`/WebGL content and `<video>` frames frequently do not rasterize correctly.
 * - Only the `<main>` content area is captured (never the assistant's own chat dock, which sits
 *   outside it — see `App.hooks.tsx`'s `useAgentPageBridge` doc for why that boundary already
 *   exists), and only what is clipped to the CURRENT viewport — content scrolled out of view is not
 *   included, by design (see {@link renderAdminScreenshotCanvas}).
 * - Complex CSS (filters, some blend modes, a custom font not yet loaded) can visually drift from
 *   what a person actually sees, since `html2canvas-pro` approximates computed styles via a cloned
 *   DOM rather than reading real compositor output.
 *
 * ## Privacy — see `agent-screenshot-bus.ts`'s module doc for the consent decision
 *
 * Every successful capture publishes {@link publishScreenshotCaptured} so the admin sees an
 * announcement, never a silent capture. This module does not call that bus directly — see this
 * file's own wiring note in `App.hooks.tsx` for why that stays the caller's responsibility.
