 * (not in the written plan file) — a chat conversation with no admin tab open can't call
 * `requestPublish` itself, so it hands back a link instead: `/admin/?publish=<encoded criteria>`.
 * {@link takePublishCriteriaFromQuery} is the one-time read/strip step for that query param, the
 * same shape `boot-token-fragment.ts`'s `takeBootToken` already established for the zip launcher's
 * `#boot=<token>` fragment — narrowed `Location`/`History` types, pure, unit-tested directly. No
 * logic belongs in `App.hooks.tsx`'s `.tsx` sibling (memory `component_logic_belongs_hooks`), so
 * this pure helper is the one place that parses or mutates the query string.
 *
 * Unlike `takeBootToken`, an invalid payload still gets stripped — `decodePublishCriteriaFromQuery`
 * already never throws and returns `null` for anything malformed (see that function's own doc), and
 * leaving a dead `?publish=` param sitting in the address bar after a bad link was followed would
 * only confuse whoever looks at it next.
