/**
 * @file The seam between "some section wants the assistant dock open" and `App.tsx`, which actually
 * owns that boolean.
 *
 * ## Why a bus rather than props
 *
 * Same reason as `settings-refresh-bus.ts`, and deliberately the same shape so there is one idiom in
 * this app rather than two. `chatOpen` lives in `App.tsx`, but sections are rendered through
 * `renderRoute(route)` — a plain function that takes a route and returns a node, with no props bag
 * to thread anything through. Giving it one solely so a single checkbox could reach `setChatOpen`
 * would put an assistant-specific parameter on the path of every unrelated section.
 *
 * ## Why this one carries state, when the settings bus does not
 *
 * `settings-refresh-bus` is fire-and-forget: subscribers re-read through their own authorized path,
 * so it can stay payload-free. Here the subscriber is a **checkbox that must show whether the dock
 * is currently open**, including when the operator opened it with the FAB instead. A signal with no
 * state would leave that control lying about the thing it claims to represent the moment the dock
 * was toggled anywhere else.
 *
 * `App.tsx` remains the owner: it publishes its state here on every change, and it listens for
 * requests. This module never opens anything itself — it only carries the ask and the answer, which
 * keeps `chatOpen`'s effects (focus handling, escape-to-close, sheet sizing) in the one place that
 * can honor them.
 *
 * The `subscribe` + `getSnapshot` pair is shaped for `useSyncExternalStore`, so a consumer gets a
 * tear-free read without this module knowing anything about React.
