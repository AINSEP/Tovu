/**
 * @file The consent/announcement signal for `admin.capture_screenshot`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists — the privacy decision behind it
 *
 * `admin.capture_screenshot`'s tool result is a picture of everything currently rendered in
 * `<main>` (`lib/agent-screenshot.ts`) — a materially larger blast radius than the existing
 * `page.*` verbs, which only ever report text/attributes an author deliberately opted into via
 * `data-agent-element`. A screenshot has no such opt-in granularity: an unmasked field value, a
 * secret mid-paste, or another admin's data rendered on screen is captured exactly as it appears,
 * whether or not anyone tagged it as agent-visible.
 *
 * The capability is still allowed by default (gating it behind a settings toggle the operator must
 * find and enable first would reproduce the exact manual-screenshot friction it exists to remove —
 * the operator already asked the assistant, in this same chat, to look at their screen). What this
 * bus buys instead is that a capture is never SILENT: the instant `agent-screenshot.ts` captures
 * anything, it calls {@link publishScreenshotCaptured}, and `App.tsx` renders a `<Toast>` naming
 * what just happened. This is "announced in the UI," not "gated by a setting" — see that file's own
 * module doc for the full option comparison. No settings-based opt-out was built in this slice;
 * a compliance-sensitive deployment wanting one is future work, not silently assumed unnecessary.
 *
 * ## Why a bus rather than a prop
 *
 * The publisher is `App.hooks.tsx`'s `useAgentPageBridge` — an effect with no relationship to
 * `App.tsx`'s own render body beyond the `agentBridge` it already returns, which carries no signal
 * for "a capability just executed." Threading one through would grow that return type for a single
 * consumer. Modeled directly on `settings-refresh-bus.ts`: fire-and-forget, no payload, because the
 * subscriber renders a fixed, already-translated message rather than anything the publisher could
 * supply that a static string does not already say.
