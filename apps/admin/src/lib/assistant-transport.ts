 * Tovu's implementation of `@jini-ai/chat-react`'s `ChatTransport` port (ADR-049).
 *
 * TWO run paths live here, selected per-turn by `getExecutionConfig()` (see
 * `createTovuAssistantTransport`'s own doc):
 *
 * 1. **Local CLI** (the original, unchanged path): binds to the real `@jini-ai/http` run surface
 *    `src/server/modules/assistant.ts` mounts — `POST /api/runs` to start, `GET
 *    /api/runs/:runId/events` (native `EventSource`) to stream, `GET /api/runs/:runId` for status,
 *    `POST /api/runs/:runId/cancel` to stop. Every SSE frame's `data` is a full `@jini-ai/protocol`
 *    `RunProtocolEvent` (`{kind, payload, ...}`), not chat-core's own `AgentEvent` — chat-core's own
 *    module doc is explicit that this reduction is a transport concern ("a host's transport adapter
 *    is responsible for reducing wire deltas... into the persisted/renderable AgentEvent items"), so
 *    `translateRunAgentPayload` below does that translation.
 * 2. **API · BYOK** (2026-08-04, ADR-049's picker): binds to `src/server/modules/assistant-byok.ts`'s
 *    `POST /api/admin/v1/assistant/byok-turn` — one request/response holding the WHOLE turn open,
 *    no separate `EventSource`/reattach/cancel-by-runId (see that route's own header for why, and
 *    what it costs). Its SSE frames carry the SAME `payload.type` vocabulary
 *    (`status`/`text_delta`/`tool_use`/`tool_result`/`usage`/`error`) `translateRunAgentPayload`
 *    already parses for path 1 — deliberately, so this path reuses that exact function rather than
 *    duplicating the translation switch.
 *
 * `text_delta`/`thinking_delta` are forwarded as their own small `AgentEvent` per delta (not
 * accumulated here) — chat-core's own `ChatMessage.events` array is what concatenates them into one
 * growing message, so accumulating twice would double the text.
