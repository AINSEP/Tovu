/**
 * @file The seam between "the assistant drew something via `assistant_render_ui`" and "the
 * Playground page wants it drawn ON THE PAGE instead of inline in the chat transcript" — the
 * whiteboard feature's whole host-side piece (Jini's A2UI transport and `render-ui-tool.ts` are
 * untouched; this is purely about where the browser puts what they already send).
 *
 * ## Why a bus rather than props
 *
 * Same shape as `assistant-dock-bus.ts`, and for the same structural reason: the two components
 * that need to agree — `components/AssistantDock/RoutedA2uiSurfaceCard.tsx` (rendered from
 * `AssistantDock.tsx`, mounted once in `App.tsx`'s `<aside>`) and `features/playground/Playground.tsx`
 * (rendered through `renderRoute(route)`, a plain function with no props bag) — are siblings under
 * `App.tsx` with no shared state between them and no path to thread a prop through. `App.tsx` never
 * needs to know this exists; unlike the dock-open bus, there is no third owner here at all.
 *
 * ## Why this one holds a DOM node, not a boolean or id
 *
 * The reader (`RoutedA2uiSurfaceCard`) needs something `ReactDOM.createPortal` can target directly.
 * A boolean ("is Playground mounted") would still leave the renderer with no container to portal
 * into; an id string would make the renderer respend a `document.getElementById` lookup for every
 * a2ui event, racing Playground's own mount/unmount. The node itself is the one value that answers
 * both "is there a target" and "where is it" in one read.
 *
 * ## Ownership
 *
 * Only `Playground.tsx` calls {@link setPlaygroundRenderTarget} — it owns the container div's
 * lifecycle (mount registers it, unmount clears it back to `null`) via a ref callback. Everything
 * else only ever reads.
