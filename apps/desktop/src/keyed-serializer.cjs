/**
 * @file Per-key promise chaining, so two calls for the SAME key never race — Tovu-Runner's
 * `serializeByProject` pattern (`project-provisioner.ts:301-332`), generalized: this file has no
 * notion of a "project", just a string key and a function to chain.
 *
 * Multi-site reintroduces exactly the race Runner built that pattern for: with one site and one
 * button, a double-click could only ever double-spawn the same single child. With N sites, each
 * exposed through its own menu entry (open, or open-recent), the same double-click risk reappears
 * per site — this closes it generically rather than needing a guard duplicated at every call site
 * (`main.cjs`'s `openSiteWindow`/`promptAndOpenNewSite`).
 *
 * Calls for DIFFERENT keys are never serialized against each other — opening site A must not wait on
 * site B's own in-flight open.
