/**
 * @file Merges the two per-arch `latest-mac.yml` update manifests into the one the release carries.
 *
 * The release workflow builds mac-arm64 and mac-x64 on separate runners (each on its own CPU, never
 * cross-built), so each job's electron-builder writes a `latest-mac.yml` listing only ITS zip. A
 * GitHub release can hold one `latest-mac.yml`, and `electron-updater`'s MacUpdater reads that one
 * file on every Mac and picks the zip by arch: a file whose URL contains `arm64` on Apple Silicon,
 * any file WITHOUT `arm64` on Intel. Upload either job's file alone and the other arch updates to a
 * binary for the wrong CPU, or finds no zip at all. So the release job merges them here and refuses
 * anything that would make that choice ambiguous.
 *
 * Only the zips are kept. MacUpdater installs from nothing else, and the dmg entries would be WRONG:
 * the workflow notarizes and staples the dmg after electron-builder wrote this manifest, which
 * changes its bytes, so the checksum listed for it no longer matches the file on the release.
 *
 * Parsing and printing YAML is the caller's job (`scripts/merge-latest-mac.ts`); this file works on
 * the parsed objects so it runs under plain `node --test` with no dependency.
