/**
 * @file Direct tests for `complexity-debt.js`.
 *
 * The two groups that matter most are the ones about results that LOOK clean:
 *
 *  - a scan that matched nothing reports zero violations, exactly like a genuinely clean scan
 *    (this repo has four complexity scopes that silently match nothing after a restructure);
 *  - ESLint exits 2 with empty stdout when a config crashes, and a caller testing `status !== 1`
 *    reads that as a pass (the admin ratchet's --rule technique does exactly this on desktop globs).
 *
 * Both are "the gate reported success while measuring nothing", which is the failure this whole
 * harness exists to make impossible.
