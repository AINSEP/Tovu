/**
 * @file Tracks window load outcomes for `TOVU_DESKTOP_SELFTEST=1`, split out of `main.ts` so the
 * completion/failure semantics are directly testable under plain `node --test` — this module has no
 * `electron` import at all; it only needs a window shaped `{ webContents: { once(event, cb),
 * getURL(), getTitle() } }`, which a fake object can satisfy just as well as a real `BrowserWindow`.
 *
 * Reporting and process control (the `console.log`/`process.exitCode`/`app.quit()` a real self-test
 * run needs) are NOT done here — they are the three injected callbacks below — so this file stays a
 * pure completion tracker and `main.ts` keeps the only code that actually touches Electron or the
 * process.
 *
 * Two, not one, ordering hazards had to be closed together — fixing only the first re-created the
 * second, confirmed live (2026-09-05) against a real 2-site launch:
 *
 * 1. **Registration must happen per-window, at creation time, not after the whole batch is open.**
 *    A single-site launch's own window finishes loading in well under a second; a multi-site
 *    launch's FIRST window can finish loading while its SECOND site's `tovu serve` is still booting
 *    (`loadURL` is fire-and-forget, and `main.ts` opens each site in its startup loop sequentially).
 *    Registering `did-finish-load` listeners only after every window in the batch exists would miss
 *    an earlier window's event entirely — Electron does not replay a past event to a listener
 *    attached after the fact. `main.ts`'s `createWindow` therefore calls this tracker's `add()` the
 *    INSTANT each window is created, before that window's own `loadURL` call.
 * 2. **The expected window COUNT must be fixed upfront, not incremented as each window is added.**
 *    Fixing (1) alone by incrementing a counter inside `add()` reintroduced a worse failure: if
 *    window 1 finishes loading before window 2 is even created (exactly the ordering (1) describes),
 *    an incrementally-built counter reads "1 of 1 done" and quits immediately — before window 2's
 *    site ever gets a chance to open at all. Seeding `remaining` from the caller's own already-known
 *    total (it always knows how many sites it is about to open) up front makes early completions
 *    correctly WAIT rather than conclude the batch is done.
