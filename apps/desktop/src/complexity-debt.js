/**
 * @file The drift rules for `apps/desktop`'s complexity ceiling, as pure functions. The CLI that
 * runs ESLint and calls these is `scripts/check-complexity.mjs`.
 *
 * Mirrors `development/scripts/check-admin-complexity-drift.ts`'s design, including the two choices
 * that file's own header argues for and which are worth restating because getting either wrong
 * makes the ratchet decorative:
 *
 * **Debt is keyed per VIOLATION, never per FILE.** ESLint's flat config has no function-level
 * scope, so a config-level relax can only ever exempt a whole file — and a per-file debt list lets
 * every OTHER function in a listed file drift unnoticed. `App.hooks.ts` is 1272 lines; exempting it
 * wholesale would create a complexity-free zone. So identity is (rule, file, message).
 *
 * **Identity deliberately excludes the line number.** Two functions in one file can produce the
 * identical message at different lines, and a line-keyed entry goes stale on every edit above it —
 * which turns the debt list into noise and trains people to regenerate it wholesale, which is the
 * same as not having one.
 *
 * ## What this file adds beyond the admin version
 *
 * A **non-vacuity check**. `main.js` reports zero violations at a 9 ceiling, which is true — forcing
 * the threshold to 1 produces 34 findings on the same file, so the rule really is reaching it. But
 * "zero violations" and "the glob matched nothing" are indistinguishable from an exit code, and
 * this repo has already shipped four complexity scopes that silently matched nothing after a
 * restructure (`check-src-complexity-drift.ts` scans nine directories; four no longer exist, and
 * `--no-error-on-unmatched-pattern` turns that into silence). So {@link evaluateRun} requires a
 * minimum linted-file count and fails when the scan shrinks, no matter how clean the result looks.
