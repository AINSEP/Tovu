/**
 * @file Where the sites home window's size and position are remembered, and the decision that
 * keeps a remembered spot from ever opening the window off-screen.
 *
 * Electron does not persist `BrowserWindow` geometry on its own — every launch starts at whatever
 * fixed size the constructor names unless something writes it down and reads it back. This is that
 * something: a JSON file in `userData` (same convention as `site-dir-store.ts`'s
 * `desktop-state.json` and `site-process-registry.ts`'s `site-processes/` files, both resolved the same way from
 * `app.getPath("userData")`), plus {@link resolveWindowBounds} — the one place that decides whether
 * a remembered rectangle is still worth trusting.
 *
 * **Why a display can make a remembered spot wrong.** A laptop undocked from an external monitor,
 * or a monitor unplugged outright, leaves yesterday's `(x, y)` pointing at empty space no display
 * now covers — Electron does not clamp this itself; the window opens exactly there, invisible and
 * unreachable except from the Window menu. {@link boundsOnScreen} is the guard: a remembered
 * rectangle is trusted only when it meaningfully overlaps some CURRENT display, checked fresh at
 * every launch rather than assumed from whenever it was saved.
 *
 * No `electron` import, so all of it is testable under plain `node --test`; `main.ts` supplies the
 * `userData` path and `screen.getAllDisplays()`.
