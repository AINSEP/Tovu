/**
 * @file The ask before the app's last window closes: "Quit Tovu and stop N running sites?" (owner
 * 2026-11-05). Closing that window with sites running otherwise either stops them with no warning
 * (Windows, Linux) or leaves them running behind a Dock icon (macOS). `main.ts` passes the native
 * box, the open servers and `app.quit` in, so every rule here runs under plain node with fakes.
 *
 * **Why Keep running minimizes on Windows and Linux.** macOS keeps an app alive with no windows, so
 * there the window closes and the Dock icon reopens it. Elsewhere a closed last window fires
 * `window-all-closed`, which quits and stops every site, and this app has no tray. A hidden window
 * would leave no way back; a minimized one stays on the taskbar, and closing it asks again, so Quit
 * is always reachable. It also needs no icon, menu or Linux tray support the way a tray would.
 *
 * **Why it latches on `before-quit`, not on `quitPhase`.** Every quit route (Cmd+Q, menu Quit, a
 * signal, Restart to update, this box's own Quit) reaches `before-quit` before any window closes,
 * so none of them may meet this box. `quitPhase` cannot say so: it stays `"idle"` when there was
 * nothing to drain, including while a macOS update is staging, and Electron's `quitAndInstall` then
 * closes the windows BEFORE its own `before-quit`. Holding a close there would abort the update.
 *
 * **Why it keeps its own window set.** `BrowserWindow.getAllWindows()` also lists the hidden capture
 * windows (`desktop-capture.ts`), so "am I the last?" would never be true while one exists.
 * `isVisible()` cannot filter them: on macOS it answers false for a window another one covers.
