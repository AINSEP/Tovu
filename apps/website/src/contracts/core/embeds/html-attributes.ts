/**
 * @file The ONE render-time HTML-attribute allowlist for every free-text `htmlAttributes` field this
 * codebase re-parses at render time: media assets, media post-nodes, and (from this task on) widget
 * post-nodes (2026-09-23 embed-attributes-everywhere plan, decision §2). It replaces two prior,
 * narrower boundaries in the same render path:
 *
 * - `@jini-ai/cms/media`'s `parseMediaHtmlAttributes` (the Jini-side twin of
 *   `apps/admin/src/features/media/rules.ts`'s `parseMediaHtmlAttributes`, which this file's
 *   tokenizer and name pattern are ported from) — rejected `style`/`id`/`class` outright and failed
 *   the WHOLE string closed on the first bad token.
 * - `render.ts`'s own `restrictToDataAriaAttributes` — an extra widget-only restriction down to
 *   `data-*`/`aria-*`, now folded into this one list instead of being a second filter layered on top.
 *
 * Two behavior changes from that prior boundary, both owner-directed:
 * 1. **The allowlist widens** to include `class`, `id`, `style`, `title`, `role`, `tabindex`, `lang`,
 *    `dir`, `hidden`, `translate` and `draggable` — global HTML attributes an author styling or
 *    animating a widget/media embed needs — on top of the open-ended `data-*`/`aria-*` families and
 *    today's `<img>`/`<video>`-only extras (`loading`, `decoding`, `playsinline`, `muted`, `loop`,
 *    `autoplay`, `poster`). One shared list for every element shape, not a list per tag: the owner
 *    rejected per-element name filtering (an extra `loading` on a `<div>` wrapper is harmless).
 * 2. **One bad token drops only that token**, not the whole string. Once a name/value pair has been
 *    tokenized, it is self-contained — dropping it cannot change how its neighbors are read — so
 *    `data-x="1" onclick="…" style="color:red"` keeps `data-x` and `style`, drops only `onclick`. The
 *    exception is `malformed`: the tokenizer itself lost sync (e.g. a stray quote), so token
 *    boundaries downstream of that point cannot be trusted (value text could re-parse as a name) —
 *    that failure mode still discards everything and fails the WHOLE string closed, same as before.
 *
 * The admin (`apps/admin/src/features/media/rules.ts`) keeps its OWN hand-copied allowlist, unchanged
 * by this task — it is a UX hint only (never gates `save()`, incident `a7cce060`), and the
 * browser/Node split between admin and this server-side file is the existing precedent (see that
 * file's own header). Widening ITS list, and Jini's write-path copy, is tracked separately (plan
 * slice J) — until then, an admin Media-library save with `style` still gets Jini's own 400.
