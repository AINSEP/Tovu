/**
 * @file Strict standard-base64 (RFC 4648 §4, padded) decoder for any inbound `dataBase64` field.
 *
 * `Buffer.from(x, "base64")` never throws — it silently skips characters outside the base64
 * alphabet instead of refusing them, so a malformed string such as `"Zm9v$"` or a truncated one
 * such as `"Zm9"` decodes to *something* rather than raising. Two upload routes
 * (`routes/publish-content/blob-put.ts` and `routes/media/upload.ts`) wrapped that call in a
 * try/catch that can never fire, which let corrupted payloads through as if they were valid.
 *
 * Adopts the same rule as Jini's module-private `http-kit/src/connectors.ts` `isWellFormedBase64`:
 * non-empty, a length that is a multiple of 4, and every character drawn from the standard
 * (non-URL) alphabet plus up to two trailing `=` pad characters. A round-trip canonical check
 * (decode, re-encode, compare) was considered and rejected: it costs an extra ~67 MB string at the
 * 50 MiB upload cap (as of 2026-09-21) and rejects nothing that matters here — non-canonical pad
 * bits (`"Zm9="`
 * decoding to the same bytes as canonical `"Zm8="`) are not a security concern for these routes.
