/**
 * @file The general tool-failure contract (2026-09-01): what ANY tool attaches to a failed outcome
 * so a caller — human, agent, or an automated retry loop — has something to reason about instead of a
 * bare status code with nothing behind it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Hand-writing a bespoke recovery path per failure mode does not scale — there will always be more
 * flaws, gaps, and provider quirks than anyone can anticipate and special-case individually. The
 * leverage is not a smarter model reading a smarter error message; it is a SHARED SHAPE every tool's
 * failure can be poured into, so one generic loop — read the failure, ask the human through a
 * surface, apply the answer, retry once — can handle a failure mode nobody wrote code for, using the
 * identical mechanism that already handles one somebody did.
 *
 * ## The four things a diagnostic carries
 *
 * 1. **What failed.** Deliberately NOT modeled in this shared contract — it is always domain-specific,
 *    and forcing every failure mode into one generic "what failed" string or object would either
 *    flatten real structure that needs to stay queryable (a concrete diagnostic's own fact fields —
 *    see {@link AuthFailureDiagnostic}'s `schemeSent`/`usernameStored` in `features/custom-credentials/
 *    credentialed-request.ts` for the worked example) or force a restructuring this file has no
 *    business demanding of every domain that wants to adopt it. A concrete diagnostic type carries
 *    its own facts as its own additional fields, declared alongside the two this contract does own.
 * 2. **The best hypothesis why** — folded into {@link ToolFailureDiagnostic.hint}.
 * 3. **What input or state would change the outcome** — also folded into `hint`, not a separate field;
 *    see that property's own doc for why the two live together.
 * 4. **Whether a registered tool can supply it** — {@link ToolFailureDiagnostic.remedyToolId}.
 *
 * ## Built from one worked example, not designed from zero
 *
 * `AuthFailureDiagnostic` is this contract's first instance, extracted AFTER it shipped and proved
 * itself against a real incident — not designed up front from a guess at what failures might someday
 * look like. See that type's own file header, "Authentication-failure diagnostics", for the incident
 * and for the exact honesty contract every one of its fields is held to. This file generalizes its
 * SHAPE, not its content: the fields that type adds (`schemeSent`, `usernameStored`) and the exact
 * wording of its `hint` are unchanged by this extraction.
 *
 * ## The honesty contract every field is held to
 *
 * - **Silence is the default, not an afterthought.** Both fields below are optional, and absent
 *   together far more often than present: a diagnostic type should fill them in for the ONE narrow
 *   shape it can honestly speak to, and stay silent for every other shape — including shapes that
 *   look superficially similar. Repeating advice that has already been tried and failed, or guessing
 *   at a cause this diagnostic cannot actually tell apart from some other one, is a false lead, not
 *   merely an unhelpful one.
 * - **Never a claim.** `hint`, when present, is hedged ("may"/"might"/"could") — a hypothesis for a
 *   human or agent to try, never an assertion of the real cause.
 * - **Additive, never a replacement.** A diagnostic rides ALONGSIDE the tool's own real failure output
 *   (a provider's response body, a thrown error's message) — it never suppresses or reinterprets it.
 * - **`hint` and `remedyToolId` travel as a pair, never `remedyToolId` alone.** A tool id with nothing
 *   explaining why it might help is a suggestion with no argument behind it, not a diagnostic. The
 *   reverse is fine: `hint` with no `remedyToolId` simply means no registered tool can supply the fix
 *   yet — the hypothesis is still worth surfacing to a human who can act on it by hand.
 *
 * ## The one-cycle guard
 *
 * `remedyToolId` is a POINTER — a tool id, nothing else. It carries no callback, no arguments, and no
 * instruction to invoke it automatically. That is deliberate: the consuming loop (ask the human → apply
 * the answer through the named tool → retry ONCE) owns the decision of whether and how to act on it,
 * and owns the guard against a second cycle. A diagnostic that carried more than an id — an executable
 * action, say — would let that guard slip into this file instead of staying where the actual retry
 * happens, turning a bug in this contract into a genuine loop instead of a single bounded retry.
 *
 * ## Architectural role
 *
 * `contracts/core`, domain-agnostic — it names no post, page, credential, or other domain concept, so
 * a failure mode in any feature can adopt it without this file growing a dependency on that feature.
