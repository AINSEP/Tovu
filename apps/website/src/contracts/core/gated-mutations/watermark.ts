/**
 * @file SPEC-016 C-004 / U-002-B1 — the dialect-neutral half of the site-wide gated-mutation write
 * watermark: the transaction-boundary guard every concrete stamping adapter is built on.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `stampWatermark` only inspects `OpenTransactionHandle.isOpen` and invokes `increment()` — it
 * never touches a schema, a table, or a SQL dialect, which is what lets it live in `core` without
 * creating a dependency on `db`. The real stamp, read and boot-time mirror reconciliation run on the
 * content kernel, every dialect (`platform/db/watermark-kernel.ts`: `kernelStampWatermark`,
 * `readKernelWatermark`, `reconcileMirror`; SPEC-016 C-004/U-004/REQ-01/REQ-04/REQ-05/INV-01). Since
 * R1h no production path adapts a transaction to this guard; it is kept with its unit test as the
 * contract's reference shape.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Core primitive shared by every gated-mutation domain (database, recovery, ...); no domain-specific
 * or dialect-specific knowledge here.
