/**
 * @file Tests for the surface exchange — a two-way, multi-message conversation with a human held
 * open inside one agent tool call (ADR-055 Decision 1, generalized).
 *
 * Two properties carry most of the weight:
 *
 * 1. **The inbound buffer.** A message arriving while the handler is between `receive()` calls must
 *    queue, not vanish. Dropping it deadlocks the exchange on an answer the human already gave — the
 *    one failure that is genuinely painful to retrofit, so it is tested before any multi-turn channel
 *    is wired to need it.
 * 2. **A message reaches at most one waiting receive, on an exchange opened by the same tool for the
 *    same principal.** That is the whole correctness contract.
 *
 * These deliberately exercise a different property from the former token-store tests. An exchange id is a
 * correlation handle, not a secret, so nothing here concerns hashing, constant-time comparison, or
 * probing resistance — asserting those would imply a security property this handle does not carry.
