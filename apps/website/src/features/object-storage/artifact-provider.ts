/**
 * @file Which object-store provider delivers backup shares: any registered provider that can also
 * hand out a single-object artifact store (today the bundled `s3_compatible`), instead of one
 * hard-coded deploy target id. The site's media choice wins when it qualifies, so media and shares
 * use one provider (and one saved connection); otherwise the first qualifying one in registry order.
 * A provider qualifies only once its saved connection resolves and passes its optional artifact
 * credential check, so an installed but unconnected
 * store never hides a connected one behind it. Revoke names the share's saved provider and resolves
 * only that one, so a store connected later can never take over (or block) another store's delete.
