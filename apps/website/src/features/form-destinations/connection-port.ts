/**
 * @file The connection port this build ships: a binding's `connectionRef` is the stable id of a
 * saved custom credential. The vault owner opens entries by label only, so the label is looked up
 * from the id, and the opened entry's id is checked again: a rename between the two reads could
 * otherwise hand this binding another account's secret. A credential is only handed to an adapter
 * its owner listed in its `worksFor`: any saved credential could otherwise be named by a binding and
 * given to any delivery plugin. An OAuth connection kind is a second `FormDeliveryConnectionPort`,
 * not a change here.
 */

/**
 * Builds the port. Every call reads the vault afresh, so a rotated or deleted credential applies to
 * the next attempt; nothing is cached or written anywhere.
 * @returns null when no entry with that id exists in `workspaceId`, its `worksFor` does not name
 *   `adapterId` (checked before the secret is opened), or the label now names another entry; the
 *   vault's own errors (e.g. an unconfigured site key) propagate.
 * @complexity One id read plus one label scan over the workspace's saved credentials and one open.
