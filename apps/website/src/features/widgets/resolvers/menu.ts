/**
 * @file `menu` (menu-as-widget) resolver (SPEC-043 REQ-09, ADR-047 §1/§9 — "the primary menu as a
 * widget in the footer region costs nothing new").
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Delegates to `navigation`'s own read model — zero menu STORAGE logic duplicated in `widgets/`
 * (`getMenu`, a real `NavMenuReadModel` call, not a reimplementation of `MenuRepoPort`) — and now
 * also zero menu-HREF-RESOLUTION logic duplicated, via `navigation/resolver.ts`'s exported
 * `resolveMenuDoc` (the doc-level building block `resolveForLocation` itself composes on top of).
 * `resolveItemList`/`resolveItem` stay module-private in `navigation/resolver.ts`; `resolveMenuDoc`
 * is the one exported entry point to their behavior, added specifically so this resolver would not
 * need either an export-widening of those internals or a location-shaped call it doesn't have.
 *
 * Historical limitation (retained to explain the fallback): real href resolution for non-`url` targets (`entryRef`/`termRef`/
 * `route`) needs `src/platform/routing` (ADR-039), which is being built in parallel and is not running code
 * yet anywhere in this codebase — not even `navigation`'s own production callers have a real
 * `ResolveTargetHrefFn` today (`resolveForLocation` takes it as an injected dependency precisely so
 * a fake can stand in until routing lands, per `navigation/resolver.ts`'s own header). This resolver
 * is in the same honest position as the rest of the system, not a special-cased worse one: `url`-kind
 * targets (already-resolved hrefs, no injected dependency needed) now resolve to real, concrete
 * `href`/`available`/`isActive` data; `entryRef`/`termRef`/`route` targets resolve to
 * `available: false, href: null` via the placeholder `resolveTargetHref` below, exactly the outcome
 * `navigation/resolver.ts`'s own doc describes for "cannot resolve" — swap the placeholder for the
 * real routing-backed implementation in one place (`DEFAULT_RESOLVE_TARGET_HREF` below) once
 * `src/platform/routing` ships; no other change needed here.
 * 2026-10-04: runtime roots now inject the routing-backed page/entry resolver. The default remains
 * useful for diagnostics; public widget assembly omits unavailable leaves while retaining parents
 * that still contain visible descendants, matching the static menu's availability contract.
