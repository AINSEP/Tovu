 * `admin.assistant.use` permission as that route.
 *
 * It fetches and validates first, then writes exactly those validated bytes (one fetch, pinned to one
 * commit). No confirmation card (owner 2026-10-07: ordinary installs run directly; trash/delete/publish ask; it shipped with
 * one in 444e9dfca and was dropped the same day) — the admin screen's own dialog is unchanged. Uploaded folders/ZIPs
 * are not a source here: the admin chat composer already installs a dropped skill through the Skills
 * screen's own upload path.
