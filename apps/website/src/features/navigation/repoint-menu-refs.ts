/**
 * @file Pure tree helpers for R1 of `ADS-memory/.local-artifacts/plan-publish-repoint-menus-2026-09-24.md`
 * ("publish 'Overwrite on live' repoints live menu links"). Two read-only/pure functions:
 * {@link repointMenuItems} rewrites `entryRef` targets that point at a retired holder to the row
 * that replaced it; {@link menuHoldersReferencing} finds which live menus hold such a link in the
 * first place, for the plan-time warning. Neither writes anything — the `menu` publish handler's
 * `referencesTo`/`repointReferences` methods (a later slice) are the write/read-through-a-repo half
 * that calls these and persists the result.
 *
 * Deviation from the design doc, recorded rather than silently dropped: §2.1/§2.4 describe an
 * `entryRef.contentType` field this helper should keep-or-update alongside `entryId`. The installed
 * `@jini-ai/cms` `NavEntryTarget` (`node_modules/@jini-ai/cms/dist/navigation/types.d.ts:50-54`,
 * `readonly kind: "entryRef"; readonly entryId: UUID;`) has never carried that field — confirmed
 * against the Jini source (`Jini/packages/cms/src/navigation/types.ts`, both of its two commits
 * touching this file leave `NavEntryTarget` exactly this shape). There is nothing to keep or update,
 * so {@link repointMenuItems} only ever touches `entryId`.

 * reference it was given, so a caller can tell "nothing changed" from `count === 0` without a second
 * deep-equality pass, and structural sharing keeps a no-match call's allocation cost independent of
 * how much of the tree it walked.
