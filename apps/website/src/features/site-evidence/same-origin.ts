/**
 * @file The same-origin boundary for `site_collect_page_evidence` — the one place that decides
 * which URL a headless browser is allowed to open on this workspace's behalf.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Unrepresentability first, validation second
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The tool's input accepts **site-relative paths**, never URLs. That is deliberate and it is the
 * primary guarantee: a caller (including a model that has been talked into fetching
 * `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`) has no input field in which an absolute URL, a host,
 * or a scheme can be expressed at all. {@link normalizeSitePath} then refuses every syntactic form
 * that could smuggle an authority through a field that is supposed to hold a path —
 * `//evil.example`, `https://evil.example`, `\\evil.example`, and anything carrying a raw control
 * character or a `..` segment.
 *
 * The origin the path is joined to comes from `OriginRegistryPort.canonicalOrigin()` (ADR-040 F2),
 * which is the workspace's own verified origin and is never derived from a request `Host` header
 * or from tool input. So "same-origin" here is not a comparison the caller can influence: the
 * origin is fixed by the workspace, and only the path varies.
 *
 * {@link isSameOriginUrl} is the SECOND layer, for the one thing the first cannot cover: a page
 * that responds with a redirect to somewhere else. The browser follows redirects, so the URL that
 * actually got loaded has to be re-checked after the fact against the same canonical origin, and a
 * page that left the origin is recorded as evidence and dropped rather than inspected.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Pure string/URL logic. No I/O, no browser, no repo — `collect-page-evidence.ts` composes this
 * with the real origin lookup and the real browser port.

 * `new URL("/pricing", "https://example.test/site/")` resolves to `https://example.test/pricing`
 * and silently discards the `/site` base path a `VerifiedOrigin` may carry. Not a security hole

 * bare origin with no path of its own, which is what makes the "cannot escape" property hold no
 * matter what `path` contains. Leading slashes on `path` are collapsed to exactly one before the
 * join specifically so a `//host` value (which {@link normalizeSitePath} already refuses, but which
