/**
 * @file `collectPageEvidence()` — the bounded orchestration behind the `site_collect_page_evidence`
 * agent tool. Resolves the workspace's own verified origin, normalizes each requested path, drives
 * the browser port once per page, and returns observed evidence.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The one rule this module exists to enforce: evidence, never a verdict
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing here scores, grades, passes, fails, or maps an observation to a regulation. There is no
 * `compliant` field and no place to put one. The tool reports what was seen and where it was seen;
 * deciding what that means is the `site-compliance` skill's job, under an output contract that
 * forbids it from stating a verdict either. Both halves have to hold — a tool that returned
 * `{ gdprCookieCheck: "pass" }` would make the skill's contract unenforceable, because the verdict
 * would already have been asserted upstream of it.
 *
 * Two consequences worth naming, because they look like missing features and are not:
 * - A page that could not be loaded produces a `skipped` entry with a reason, never an empty
 *   observation. "Nothing observed" and "observed nothing" are different facts and a report that
 *   confuses them is worse than no report.
 * - When the browser is unavailable, EVERY page is `skipped` with that reason and `pages` is empty.
 *   There is no configuration-derived fallback, because a fallback would be a guess wearing the
 *   evidence tool's credibility.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Bounds
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every axis a hostile or careless caller could drive unbounded is capped by
 * {@link SITE_EVIDENCE_LIMITS}, and each cap is reported back in the result so a reader can tell a
 * truncated list from a complete one. Per skills/implementation-guardrails' resource-bounds rule:
 * maximum collection size (`maxPagesPerCall`), per-call timeout (`maxPageLoadMs`), overall deadline
 * (`maxTotalMs`), and explicit behaviour at the cap (excess pages are `skipped` with reason
 * `page-cap`, never silently dropped).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing is persisted
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This module writes no file, no database row, and no cache. The browser adapter uses an ephemeral
 * context with no user-data directory. What the tool observed exists only in the value it returns,
 * and the shapes in `browser-port.ts` cannot represent a cookie value, a request body, or a form
 * field's contents in the first place.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Pure orchestration over two injected dependencies (an origin resolver and a browser factory).
 * No global state, no module-level singletons — `tool-registrations.ts` supplies both.
