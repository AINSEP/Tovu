import type { SiteBackupPushProgress } from "./push-engine.js";

/**
 * @file Runs `site_backup_push`'s upload as an in-process job, so a backup can outlast one tool call.
 *
 * Why: a delegated tool call is cut off after 6 minutes (`@jini-ai/mcp`'s
 * `DEFAULT_DELEGATED_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS`), and a 212 MiB backup — about 283 MB of base64 on the wire,
 * plus any rate-limit waits — can take longer on a home connection. The push call waits for its job
 * up to a budget; if the job is still running then, the call returns its progress, and calling
 * `site_backup_push` again with the same planId waits on the SAME job. A second call never starts a
 * second upload, and the backup is still exactly one commit.
 *
 * A job is keyed by its planId and bound to the principal and workspace that started it, like the
 * plan itself. Its outcome is handed to the first call that sees it finish, then forgotten, so a
 * later call with that planId reads as not found. A finished outcome nobody collected is dropped
 * after {@link FINISHED_JOB_TTL_MS}. In memory only: a server restart drops every job.
