 * @file The per-section authorize-then-collect step both Site Inspection aggregators share:
 * `buildSiteProfile` (`site-profile.ts`) and `buildSiteCapabilities` (`site-capabilities.ts`).
 * Extracted from `site-profile.ts` when the second aggregator arrived, so "authorize each section on
 * its own permission, never let one section fail the call, never put an error message in the
 * response" has one implementation rather than two that can drift apart.
 *
 * `site-profile.ts`'s header explains why that shape is structural rather than a convention: an
 * aggregator gated on one permission would be a privilege-escalation shortcut around every domain
 * gate it aggregates.
