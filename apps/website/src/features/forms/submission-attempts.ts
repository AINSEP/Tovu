/**
 * @file `submission-attempts.ts` — remembers, in this process only and for a short window, which
 * public form submissions were just accepted, so a double-clicked Send stores ONE row.
 *
 * Why an attempt token, not the body (2026-10-05, replacing the 2026-10-04 derived-id dedupe): an
 * IP + body key cannot tell a double click from two people behind one office NAT giving the same
 * answer, and deriving the permanent submission id from it left an unsalted IP hash in every row
 * after the 90-day IP sweep. The page now carries a fresh `_attempt` token per response
 * (`injectFormAttemptTokens`, `http/site/form-render.ts`), so a double click repeats one token while
 * two visitors, or the same visitor after a reload, send different ones. Ids are random again.
 *
 * What still shares a token: a static export (the server cannot vary a file per visitor, so it
 * ships none) and a page a shared HTTP cache served to several visitors. Those, and API callers that
 * send no token, fall back to the old IP + body comparison for the same window. Only identical
 * answers from one IP within the window collapse, as before.
 *
 * Why process memory, not a table: the claim must be atomic, short-lived and never persisted (it is
 * an IP-derived hash). One Node process makes check-then-claim atomic with no await between them;
 * a restart or a second machine only forgets recent claims, which stores a duplicate rather than
 * dropping a submission. Same one-process-lifetime shape as the forms rate limiter.
