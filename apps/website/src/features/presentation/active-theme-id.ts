/**
 * @file "Which theme id does this workspace have configured" — split out of
 * `features/theme/active-theme.ts` 2026-08-16 (same-day follow-up to that file's own move) once
 * measurement showed this specific function has ZERO dependency on theme data: it only reads
 * `PresentationSettingsRepoPort` and returns a bare string, never touching `DiscoveredTheme` or
 * `findTheme`. Homing it in `features/theme` alongside {@link resolveActiveTheme} (which DOES need
 * theme data) would have created a real `features/theme -> features/presentation` edge for no
 * reason — and `features/presentation` was independently confirmed (via this repo's own
 * `check:architecture` dependency-cruiser graph, Tarjan SCC computed before/after) to already be a
 * member of the pre-existing 36-module fused strongly-connected component, while `features/theme`
 * was not. That edge would have pulled `features/theme` into the SCC — a real, measured,
 * AVOIDABLE regression this split exists to prevent. See
 * `ADS-memory/reports/2026-08-16-export-edge-decoupling.md` for the full before/after.
 *
 * Imports directly from `@jini-ai/cms/presentation` rather than this module's own
 * `#src/features/presentation/index` barrel — a sibling file re-importing its own directory's
 * barrel is unnecessary indirection; `index.ts` re-exports the identical external symbols this file
 * needs, so there is no local logic being bypassed.
