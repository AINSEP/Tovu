/**
 * @file Direct-invocation unit tests for `resolveActiveThemeId` (this dispatch). It IS reached
 * indirectly today — `pages.route.test.ts` exercises its happy path and its
 * `PresentationSettingsNotFoundError` -> `""` fallback through the `/welcome` and `/` routes — but
 * that file never imports this module by name, and neither of those two route tests forces the
 * one branch a route can't easily trigger: a repo failure that is NOT
 * `PresentationSettingsNotFoundError`, which this function must re-throw unchanged rather than
 * swallow. Testing all three outcomes directly, against the real function, closes that gap and
 * pins the file's own documented contract (its header) to executable assertions.
