/**
 * @file `storefront.ts` — maps Commerce catalog records into the public site render pipeline's
 * product shape (2026-08-12: "wire products into template render data").
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The render pipeline's `SiteProduct` (`src/server/http/site/render.ts`) is deliberately shaped
 * structurally rather than imported from a specific data source's module — its own doc says so
 * explicitly, for the sample store plugin, so the core render engine never depends on any one
 * plugin/feature's types. This module keeps that same decoupling in the other direction:
 * `features/commerce` does not import `SiteProduct` or anything from `server/http/site` — it
 * returns a plain object structurally compatible with it, and the route layer
 * (`server/routes/site/products.ts`) is what bridges the two, exactly as `SiteProduct`'s own doc
 * already establishes as the pattern.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT included in this mapping this pass, named explicitly rather than silently
 * dropped:
 *  - `images` — a real product image needs the ADR-027 transform-registry pipeline
 *    (`mediaTransformVersions`, `renderImageTag`) to produce a safe, validated `/m/...` URL; a
 *    shortcut construction here would bypass that validation. The templates already degrade
 *    gracefully to a placeholder card when `images` is absent (see `fashion-modern/templates/
 *    products.liquid`'s own header comment), so omitting it is a safe, honest default, not a
 *    silent gap.
 *  - `stock` — Commerce has no inventory-tracking table yet (only the unrelated sample `store`
 *    plugin does, via `p_store__products.stock` with a real OCC-guarded decrement). Fabricating a
 *    number here would violate the standing "never present unproven capability as working" rule
 *    (this feature's own context packet, C5). `SiteProduct.stock` is widened to optional so a
 *    Commerce-sourced product can honestly omit it rather than claim a specific count.
 *  - `description` — a SECURITY omission, not a data-availability one: `CommerceProductRecord
 *    .description` is a plain `text()` column with no HTML-sanitization contract (no admin UI even
 *    writes it yet — `db/schema.ts`'s `commerceProducts.description` doc names no format at all).
 *    `product.liquid` renders `product.description` via Liquid's `| raw` filter — the SAME trust
 *    contract `post.content` uses, but `post.content` earns that trust by walking a controlled
 *    TipTap doc-JSON AST (`renderDocNode`) that only ever emits an allowlisted set of tags; a plain
 *    string column has no equivalent guarantee. Wiring this field through unescaped the moment any
 *    admin (or seed script) puts `<script>`-shaped text in a product description would be a live
 *    XSS hole, not a hypothetical one. Revisit only alongside either (a) a sanitizer at the write
 *    path, or (b) switching the template to escaped (non-`| raw`) output.
 *
 * Included this pass, both safe because `product.liquid`/`products.liquid` render them WITHOUT
 * `| raw` (LiquidJS's `outputEscape: "escape"` default applies — see `liquid-worker.ts` — so any
 * hostile content in either is HTML-escaped, not executed):
 *  - `specs` — passed straight through from `CommerceProductRecord.specs`; already structured
 *    `{label, value}` display data, not a data-availability or safety gap.
 *  - `currency` — passed straight through from `CommercePriceRecord.currency`, lowercase ISO-4217
 *    (e.g. `"usd"`), matching Stripe's own convention (see `types.ts`'s doc on that field). The
 *    design's currency badge was mocked uppercase; `priceFormatted`'s own `$`-prefix is also
 *    hardcoded regardless of this value (see `render.ts`'s `formatCents` doc) — both are cosmetic
 *    mismatches for a future currency-formatting pass, not blockers for wiring the raw value.
