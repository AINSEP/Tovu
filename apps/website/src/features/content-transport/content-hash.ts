/**
 * @file Task 1 of the content-transport (Publish Content) feature —
 * `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-18-publish-feature-implementation-plan.md` §4, task 1.
 *
 * This is the property the whole feature's safety case rests on (plan §5, risks #1–#3, #10):
 * `version` and `updatedAt` cannot answer "is this row unchanged since we last synced?" across two
 * independently-running databases — identical content on two instances has different `version`
 * counters and different real-world save timestamps, and a naive comparison would report every
 * unchanged row as a conflict (or, worse, every genuinely-edited row as unchanged, if a caller
 * compared the wrong thing). `contentHash()` is a pure function of the entity's OWN content — never
 * its identity or its write-bookkeeping — so two databases holding the same logical content always
 * agree, and any real edit always disagrees.
 *
 * `CONTENT_HASH_VERSION` travels alongside every hash this module produces (in a bundle, in a
 * baseline row — see `type-registry.ts`'s `PackedEntity.hashVersion`) rather than being folded into
 * the hash bytes themselves, so two instances on different versions can detect the mismatch
 * (plan §5 risk #10: "refuse the run", not "silently produce an all-conflicts report") instead of
 * the version simply being unrecoverable from an opaque hex string. Bump this constant — deliberately,
 * never as a side effect of an unrelated change — any time `canonicalize`'s output for the same
 * logical input would change. The pinned snapshot test in this module's own test file exists
 * specifically to force that decision to be conscious.

 * Excluded so that the same logical content produces the same hash regardless of which database
 * it lives on, how many times it has been saved, or whether a standing-draft autosave happens to
 * be parked alongside it.
 *
 * - `id` / `workspaceId`: identity, not content. A pull that preserves the source id (plan §1.3)
 *   still must not let the id's own bytes perturb the content comparison.
 * - `version`: a per-database write counter, not a content property — see this file's header.
 * - `updatedAt`: a per-write wall-clock stamp; two saves of byte-identical content produce two
 *   different timestamps, which must never register as a content change.
 * - `autosaveJson`: a standing, not-yet-saved draft that sits beside a row without describing its
 *   real (last-saved) state. Named explicitly, even though {@link PostRecord} carries no such field
 *   itself (autosave lives in a separate `readAutosave`/`writeAutosave` seam) — a future entity
 *   `canonicalize` is asked to hash may realistically pass this key straight out of a raw row shape.
 * - `createdByPrincipalId` / `createdAt` (Task 15, 2026-09-18, plan §4 task 15): per-instance
 *   authorship PROVENANCE, not content — the same class of fact `id`/`workspaceId` already are.
 *   Excluding them is what lets the importer copy the source's own values onto a `created` row
 *   verbatim (plan's own requirement: "do not let an importer re-stamp every post with the importing
 *   operator's id") without that copy ever being mistaken for a content edit by two instances whose
 *   own local values for these fields legitimately differ (e.g. before vs. after this feature existed
 *   pre-migration `null`s, or simply two independently-running databases disagreeing on wall-clock
 *   `createdAt`). Without this exclusion, hashing two otherwise-identical posts that merely disagree
 *   on who created them (or when) would report `conflict`/`unchanged` incorrectly.

 * Both rewrites exist for the same reason: `JSON.stringify` alone gives two different readers of
 * "the same" logical object two different byte strings whenever (a) the object's own key insertion
 * order differs (a JS engine/adapter detail, not a content fact — e.g. a SQLite adapter's `toRecord`
 * building a `PostRecord` literal in one field order vs. an in-memory adapter's own literal), or
 * (b) one reader represents "this optional field was never set" as a missing key and another
 * represents it as `{field: undefined}` — `JSON.stringify` silently DROPS an object property whose
 * value is `undefined`, so those two shapes would otherwise canonicalize identically to "key absent"
 * only by accident, and inconsistently once a caller's undefined happens to sit inside an array
 * (where `JSON.stringify` instead emits `null`, not drop-the-element). Converting every `undefined`
 * to an explicit `null` up front makes the "field never set" contract uniform and documented instead
 * of borrowed accidentally from `JSON.stringify`'s own array/object inconsistency.
