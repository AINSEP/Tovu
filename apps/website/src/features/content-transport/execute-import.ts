 * @file Task 7 of the content-transport (Publish Content) feature —
 * `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-18-publish-feature-implementation-plan.md` §4 task 7 / §5 risk #6.
 *
 * `executeContentTransportImport` mirrors `features/database/migrate-forward/execute.ts`'s
 * `executeMigrateForward` shape exactly: refuse `costClass: 'unavailable'` BEFORE the gated-mutation
 * gateway's own `execute()` ever runs, so a mutation this instance cannot take a real restore point
 * for is refused with no attestation override (ADR-041 §2's "no attestation override" rule, reused
 * here rather than re-argued) — not merely refused inside `hooks.executeMutation()`, which would
 * already be past `execute()`'s authorize/token/actor-class/plan-hash checks and would have looked,
 * from the caller's perspective, like "everything passed, then it failed" instead of "this was never
 * going to be allowed".
 *
 * Unlike `executeMigrateForward`, this wrapper does NOT acquire `core/operation-lock.ts`'s shared
 * cross-domain lock — that lock exists for the `migration`/`restore` operation-kind pair specifically
 * (ADR-041 §3, SPEC-019 CIC U-003), and content-transport's own concurrency story (per-write
 * `expectedVersion` racing against `saveIfVersion`'s atomic `UPDATE … WHERE version = ?`, plan §5
 * risk #3) is a different, already-adequate mechanism Task 8 owns. Adding this domain to that lock's
 * `operationKind` union is out of this task's scope and not requested by the plan.
