/**
 * @file Task 6 of the content-transport (Publish Content) feature —
 * `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-18-publish-feature-implementation-plan.md` §4 task 6.
 *
 * Pure helpers for the blob pre-flight routes (`blobs/probe`, `blobs/:sha`). Kept separate from the
 * route handlers so the security-critical property below has a direct unit test that needs no
 * Express request/response, no `BlobStorePort`, and no auth harness.
 *
 * ## The property this file exists to hold
 *
 * `BlobStorePort.putIfAbsent` (`@jini-ai/cms/media`'s `ports.ts`) does NOT verify that the bytes it
 * is given actually hash to the `sha256` it is told — it only uses that string to derive the
 * storage key (`computeBlobStorageKey`) and writes an create-only object there. Read directly:
 * `blob-store.fs.ts`'s `putIfAbsent` opens `ws/{workspaceId}/blobs/{sha256[0..1]}/{sha256}` with
 * `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` and writes whatever bytes it was handed — it trusts its caller's `sha256`
 * completely. In this feature, the sha IS the identity (baselines, `PackedEntity.requiredBlobs`,
 * `blobManifest` all address a blob by its claimed hash) — accepting bytes that do not actually
 * hash to their claimed sha256 would let a caller poison content-addressed storage: a later reader
 * asking "do you have blob X" would get `true` for bytes that are not actually X. The PUT route
 * MUST call {@link bytesMatchSha256} and refuse a mismatch BEFORE ever calling `putIfAbsent` —
 * `putIfAbsent` itself will not catch it.
 */

/** Lowercase 64-hex-character shape a sha256 digest must have. Rejects anything else (wrong
 *  length, uppercase, non-hex) before it is ever used to build a storage key or a DB row — the
 *  route-layer input-shape gate the interface routes to this file's real check. */
