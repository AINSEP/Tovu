 *  content-type storage leaves all URLs unresolved; missing transforms leaves only image URLs
 *  unresolved. Content-type recording is a no-op without its store. `RouteDeps` (this host's real
 *  composition-root deps bag) always supplies both in production — `mediaContentTypeStore`/
 *  `transformDefinitionRepo` are established `RouteDeps` fields (`server/routes/types.ts`), not new
 *  wiring this file introduces. `mediaContentTypeStore` is `Pick`-narrowed to only the two methods
 *  this file actually calls, not the whole `MediaContentTypeStorePort`, so a caller passing a
 *  purpose-built double for either half never needs to fake the other. */
