/**
 * @file Per-workspace media-generation vendor credentials — what the admin's Media → "Media
 * providers" tab reads and writes. Backs the `MediaProvidersPort` contract in `@jini-ai/ui`
 * (`features/media-providers/ports.ts`), whose two methods this file's two functions answer.
 *
 * WORKSPACE-scoped, not per-principal like `assistant/execution-credential-store.ts`: generation
 * spends real money and publishes assets site-wide, so the install holds one vendor roster. See
 * `db/schema.sqlite.ts`'s `mediaProviderCredentials` header for the full reasoning.
 *
 * Two functions, matching the port exactly:
 * - {@link getMediaProviderCredentials} — read model only. Never decrypts (`keyTail` is a plain
 *   column computed at write time), so it cannot fail on a misconfigured site key.
 * - {@link saveMediaProviderCredentials} — WHOLE-MAP REPLACE, including deletion. The tab's
 *   `saveMediaProviders` sends its entire local map and treats an absent provider as a tombstone
 *   (see `useMediaProvidersTab`'s `flushNow`), so a provider missing from the payload must be
 *   deleted here, not merely left alone.
 *
 * Neither function ever returns key material. The response carries only `apiKeyConfigured` and
 * `apiKeyTail`, which is the "markers" half of the two-kinds-of-present distinction
 * `@jini-ai/ui`'s `types.ts` documents.
 *
 * {@link resolveMediaProviderCredential} — added 2026-09-02 for `media-generation/tool-registrations.ts`'s
 * `media_generate_asset`, the first real decrypting reader this table has ever had. Mirrors
 * `custom-credentials/store.ts`'s own `resolveCustomCredentialByLabel` exactly.
 *
 * Jini binds the workspace and vault identity before opening sealed JSON. Legacy AAD handling
 * lives exclusively in boot normalization/recovery; feature reads never try a legacy fallback.

   * iff every step succeeds; rolls back and rethrows if `plan` throws or any write fails.
   *
   * The read lives INSIDE the boundary on purpose. `saveMediaProviderCredentials` merges each
   * submitted entry against the stored row (an entry with no `apiKey` keeps the stored key, and
   * `createdAt` is preserved), so a read taken before the boundary opens can be stale by the time
   * the merge is written: a concurrent rotation landing in that window would be silently reverted
   * by a metadata-only save that re-wrote the key it had read a moment earlier.
   *
   * `plan` is synchronous by type, which is the second half of the fix — see
   * {@link MediaProviderCredentialReplacePlanner}. Everything that must await (sealing a new key)
   * happens before this method is called.
   *
   * Not reentrant — callers invoke this exactly once, at the outermost level of their own body.
   *
   * @returns the rows written, with authoritative hints and private vault context.
