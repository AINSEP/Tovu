/**
 * @file `chat_list_pending_attachments` — lets the assistant discover a chat attachment it was never
 * told about in this run: the discovery half of the bridge `promote-chat-attachment.ts` completes
 * (see that file's own header for the capability gap both close together).
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * `media_promote_chat_attachment` takes an attachmentRef. Discovery originally supplied missing
 * refs from earlier turns by listing all pending uploads for an owner. That exposed unrelated
 * conversations during the 2026-10-06 live test. Discovery now supplies refs only for this accepted
 * message; actual image delivery is independent and uses byte-bearing content at run start.
 *
 * ## Scoping — the actual security decision here
 *
 * `AttachmentStore.listPendingForOwner` (`@jini-ai/daemon/http`) only returns records carrying an
 * `ownerId` that matches the id passed in. With this run's id it includes unclaimed records and
 * records claimed by this run: startup claims all message attachments before tools execute, so
 * unclaimed-only discovery would hide images, videos and generic files alike. This tool always
 * passes `ctx.principal.id` — the SAME Tovu admin-session identity `agent-daemon-server.ts` decodes
 * from a run's `contextRef` (`parseRunStartContextRef`'s `principalId`, itself
 * `getAuthedPrincipal(res).id` at the proxy) and records in `principalByRunId`. That identity is
 * exactly what `forwardAttachmentUpload`
 * (`server/runtime/composition/modules/assistant.ts`) now stamps into every upload's
 * `RUN_PRINCIPAL_HEADER` before it ever reaches the daemon's `AttachmentStore.register()` — the same
 * header `run-ownership.ts` already uses to scope run access, reused for the identical reason: it is
 * only trustworthy downstream of the daemon's bearer gate, which every route in this process sits
 * behind, so nothing a renderer sends can forge it.
 *
 * Net effect: this tool can never surface an attachment uploaded under a different admin's session,
 * and it can never surface one uploaded before this scoping existed (an ownerless record) — both are
 * excluded by `listPendingForOwner`'s own contract (see that method's doc), not by a check
 * duplicated here. Cross-site reach is structurally impossible for the same reason
 * `promote-chat-attachment.ts` gives: one `AttachmentStore` per site daemon, keyed by
 * `TOVU_WORKSPACE`.
 *
 * Discovery is further restricted to the refs in this run's accepted message. The host resolves
 * that binding from the daemon's contextRef, never from tool arguments. An absent binding means
 * no results: neither another conversation nor an earlier message may donate pending files.
