/**
 * @file Read-back for one chat attachment's bytes, authorized by the uploading principal.
 *
 * ## The capability this closes
 *
 * `@jini-ai/http-kit`'s attachment route pack mounts exactly two routes — `POST /api/attachments`
 * and `DELETE /api/attachments` (`registerAttachmentRoutes`) — so bytes could be staged and
 * abandoned but never read again. The admin's attachment preview modal therefore worked only for
 * the current session, off a client-side `File` cache keyed by upload path
 * (`apps/admin/.../attachment-preview-cache.ts`): anything from an earlier turn, or anything at all
 * after a reload, could never be previewed. This module is the server half that makes those bytes
 * reachable; `routes/assistant/get-chat-attachment.ts` is the HTTP half.
 *
 * ## Why this reads the store's on-disk records instead of calling the store
 *
 * The `AttachmentStore` port has no non-mutating, owner-scoped byte read:
 * - `resolveForRun(ref, runId)` returns the real path, but **claims** the attachment for `runId` on
 *   the first call. A preview that claimed what it previewed would delete the attachment at that
 *   run's cleanup and hide it from `chat_list_pending_attachments` — a preview must not consume the
 *   thing it previews.
 * - `listPendingForOwner(ownerId)` is non-mutating and owner-scoped, but returns only summaries
 *   (`ref`/`name`/`kind`/`size`/`createdAt`) — never a path — and deliberately excludes anything
 *   already claimed, which is precisely the "attachment from an earlier turn" case this exists for.
 *
 * The remaining source of truth is the sidecar record `createDiskAttachmentStore` writes under
 * `<uploadDirectory>/.records/` when constructed with `retainAcrossRestarts` (Tovu opts in at
 * `agent-daemon-server.ts`, commit `72e1e529`). That is what this module reads.
 *
 * **This is a real coupling to another package's on-disk format, stated rather than hidden.**
 * `@jini-ai/http-kit` exports `parsePersistedAttachment` and `attachmentSidecarFileName` from
 * `attachments.ts`, but its `package.json` publishes only the `.` entry point and `index.ts` does
 * not re-export either, so neither is importable from here. The shape checks below are therefore a
 * deliberate re-implementation of `parsePersistedAttachment`'s two load-bearing guarantees (a
 * well-formed record, and a `filePath` contained by its own re-derived batch directory), and
 * `isUnchangedAttachment` — which IS on the package's public surface — is imported rather than
 * re-implemented so the integrity gate itself cannot drift.
 *
 * The clean fix is a `readForOwner(ref, ownerId)` method on `AttachmentStore` itself, which is a
 * change to `@jini-ai/http-kit`. Worth revisiting the moment that package is being edited anyway;
 * this module becomes a thin call into it and every check below is deleted.
 *
 * ## Authorization
 *
 * One rule: **the bytes are readable only by the principal whose id the store recorded as this
 * attachment's `ownerId`, and an attachment with no recorded `ownerId` is readable by nobody.**
 *
 * That id is not self-asserted. `forwardAttachmentUpload` (`composition/modules/assistant.ts`)
 * stamps `RUN_PRINCIPAL_HEADER` from `getAuthedPrincipal(res).id` — a server-verified session
 * principal, never anything the browser chose — and the daemon records it via
 * `AttachmentsHttpDeps.resolveOwnerId`. The read side compares against the same kind of value, in
 * the process that mints it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wider:
 * - not "any authenticated admin". `chat_list_pending_attachments` scopes by admin account rather
 *   than by conversation, an accepted widening recorded in
 *   `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-06-tovu-f6-outstanding-worklist.md` §A.6. This route matches that
 *   scope and does not go past it — one principal, their own uploads.
 * - not gated by an additional `authorize()` permission either, and that is not an omission: the
 *   upload route itself requires only `requireAdminSession` (`modules/assistant.ts`), so a
 *   permission gate here would refuse a principal their own upload. Same reasoning the admin BYOK
 *   execution-credential routes give for having no `authorize()` call (`routes/assistant/deps.ts`):
 *   the record is scoped to the principal, so there is no other principal's data to reach.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT narrower: an attachment already claimed by a run is still readable by its owner.
 * The feature is "preview an attachment from an earlier turn", and an attachment from an earlier
 * turn is by definition one a run already claimed. (The sidecar does not persist `claimedRunId` at
 * all — see `PersistedAttachmentRecord`'s own doc — so claim state is not observable here in any
 * case.)
 *
 * Every refusal reaches the caller as one indistinguishable outcome. The `ChatAttachmentRefusal`
 * contract values exist so tests can assert *which* check fired; the HTTP layer collapses all of them
 * into a single 404 with a single fixed message, so a caller cannot tell "no such attachment" from
 * "someone else's attachment" — the same non-disclosure `AttachmentStore.resolveForRun` documents
 * for its own rejections.
 *
 * ## Path safety
 *
 * A `ref` is caller-controlled and a sidecar's contents are only as trustworthy as write access to
 * the upload root, so neither is used as a path without being proved non-traversing first:
 * 1. `ref` must match {@link CHAT_ATTACHMENT_REF_PATTERN} — `attachment:` plus `[A-Za-z0-9-]` only.
 *    No `.`, `/`, `\`, or NUL can appear, so no `..` segment and no absolute path can be spelled.
 *    Express decodes `:ref` before a handler sees it, so a percent-encoded `%2F`/`%2E%2E` arrives
 *    decoded and is rejected here, not silently routed.
 * 2. the sidecar path is `resolve`d and its `dirname` must equal the sidecar directory exactly.
 * 3. the sidecar's own `batchId` must match {@link BATCH_ID_PATTERN}, the batch directory is
 *    re-derived from the *canonical upload root* (never read from the sidecar), and the record's
 *    `filePath` must have that directory as its exact parent — the same parent-equality containment
 *    `AttachmentStore.register` applies to an upload path. A forged sidecar can therefore only ever
 *    name a file directly inside the upload root.
 * 4. the file itself must pass `isUnchangedAttachment`: a regular non-symlink file whose `realpath`
 *    equals its own path (so neither it nor any parent directory became a symlink after
 *    registration) and whose `dev`/`ino`/`size` and recorded `mtimeMs`/`ctimeMs` still match.
 *    Legacy sidecars may omit timestamps, matching the store's compatibility contract.
 * 5. bytes come from one opened descriptor, with `O_NOFOLLOW` where supported. Its `fstat`
 *    identity must match the validated file before reading, so a later path swap cannot redirect
 *    the read. The descriptor is closed on success, refusal, or read failure.
