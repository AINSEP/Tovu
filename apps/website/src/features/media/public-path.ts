 * Readable-slugs plan (2026-09-23), S1: every URL builder used to template `record.id` directly,
 * with one comment explaining why (`features/widgets/resolver-service.ts`'s pre-S2 note — a rename
 * would break a URL already baked into rendered HTML). That is no longer the reason to prefer the
 * id: `media_slug_history` (S2a/S2b) makes a retired slug keep resolving, so emitting the CURRENT
 * slug is safe. This slice only builds and tests the two functions; the four existing callers
 * (`render.ts`'s `renderImageTag`/`renderVideoTag`, `seo/media.ts`'s `buildSeoImageUrl`,
 * `tool-registrations.ts`'s `resolveOneAssetPublicUrl`) move onto {@link mediaPublicPath} in this
 * same slice but keep passing the id, so their output is byte-identical. Actually emitting a slug
 * (calling {@link mediaUrlKey} at each call site) is S3/S4's job, once the rename-safety and
 * cache-split slices (S2a, S2b) are in.
