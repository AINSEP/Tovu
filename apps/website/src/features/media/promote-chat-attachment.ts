/**
 * @file The chat-attachment -> media-library bridge: `media_promote_chat_attachment`, closing the
 * capability gap `2026-09-06-handoff-to-tovu-73.md` diagnosed — `media_upload_asset`
 * (`@jini-ai/cms/media`) only ever accepted `dataBase64`, and nothing bridged a file the chat
 * composer had already uploaded (`@jini-ai/http-kit`'s `AttachmentStore`) into it.
 *
 * ## Design: delegate to `media_upload_asset`'s own handler, don't re-implement it
 *
 * This module resolves an attachment reference to real bytes and a sniffed content type, then calls
 * the ALREADY-REGISTERED `media_upload_asset` `ToolHandler` directly with a synthesized
 * `{filename, contentType, dataBase64}` input — the exact same code path a model's own
 * `media_upload_asset` call takes, including its `requireToolPermission` check, `uploadMedia()`
 * validation/rendition gate, and the `recordUploadContentType`/`resolvePublicUrls` hooks
 * (`features/media/tool-registrations.ts`'s `buildMediaRegistrationsForTovu`). Nothing about that
 * gate is duplicated here — `__tests__/promote-chat-attachment.test.ts` proves this by asserting the
 * SAME sniffed-content-type-recording behavior `tool-registrations.test.ts` polices for
 * `media_upload_asset` itself, reached through this bridge instead.
 *
 * `contentType` is never taken from the caller (the model): it is sniffed from the real bytes via
 * `@jini-ai/cms/media`'s `sniffContentType` — the same function `buildRecordUploadContentType`
 * already uses for the AFTER-upload recording step. `media_upload_asset` itself still validates a
 * caller-DECLARED `contentType` against an advisory allowlist (see that tool's own catalog doc);
 * supplying the real, sniffed value here closes that trust gap for this path specifically, rather
 * than trusting a model's (or an attacker's) guess at what the bytes are.
 *
 * ## Why the reference is an id OR a path, not only an id
 *
 * `@jini-ai/daemon`'s `image-prompt-delivery.ts` narrates an already-claimed attachment into the
 * run's prompt text by its REAL ABSOLUTE PATH, never by the opaque `attachment:<uuid>` capability id
 * the original upload response carried (that id reaches only the composer's own client state, never
 * the model). A same-turn "attach this and add it to my library" ask is therefore the common case
 * where the model has the path but was never given the id at all. `AttachmentStore.resolveForRun`
 * (`@jini-ai/http-kit`) accepts either form and resolves both through the store's own record —
 * never a bare `fs.readFile` of a caller-asserted path. A path/id the store never issued or claimed
 * resolves to `undefined`, exactly like an unrecognized id; this bridge never reads a path the store
 * itself did not already vouch for.
 *
 * ## Authorization
 *
 * `resolveForRun` refuses a reference already claimed by a DIFFERENT run (e.g. a different chat
 * session on this same site's daemon) — see that method's own doc. This bridge inherits that scoping
 * by always passing `ctx.run.id`, so one session can never promote another session's in-flight
 * attachment through this tool. It does NOT (and structurally cannot) reach across SITES: each site
 * runs its own daemon process with its own in-memory `AttachmentStore` (`agent-daemon-server.ts`'s
 * own `TOVU_WORKSPACE` doc), so a reference minted on one site's daemon is not a key that exists in
 * another site's store at all.
 *
 * What this does NOT close: an attachment that was never claimed by any run yet (the common real
 * case an operator hits — see this file's own test suite header) has no run-ownership history at
 * all, so the FIRST `resolveForRun` call for it succeeds for whichever run asks first — the same
 * deliberate capability-bearer model `AttachmentStore.claim()` already documents for a first claim.
 * That is unchanged by this bridge, not introduced by it.
