 * @file Proves `hydrateBlobStoreFromSeed()` — the fix for the production incident this pair of
 * files exists to close: `content.seed.db` ships real `media`/`asset_blobs` ROWS on first boot
 * (`hydrate-content-db-from-seed.ts`), but nothing ever shipped the BYTES those rows'
 * `storage_key`s point at, so every admin-media preview 500'd against a real row and a missing
 * file. See `hydrate-blob-store-from-seed.ts`'s own file header for the full incident writeup and
 * design rationale (per-key gate vs. whole-directory gate, `BlobStorePort` vs. raw filesystem).
 *
 * The first test below is deliberately written to assert the FAILURE state first —
 * `blobStore.exists()` returning `false` for a seeded key is exactly the condition that makes the
 * real admin route (`server/inbound/admin-http/routes/media/original.ts`) 500 — before hydrating,
 * so the fix this function provides is visible in the test itself, not just asserted by name.
