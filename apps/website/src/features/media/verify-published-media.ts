/**
 * @file Media's post-publish safety check (`PublishContentHandler.verifyApplied`), added after the
 * 2026-09-26 live bug: a published video rendered as a broken `<img>` because the receiving site had
 * no recorded content type for it, and its poster (named only in the video's `htmlAttributes`) was
 * never sent. Both went unreported. This runs on the RECEIVING site after the apply loop's rows have
 * landed and answers, per media item, "will this actually show?":
 *
 * - the row is here and its bytes are in the blob store (else nothing can be served);
 * - its content type is recorded — the only thing the embed resolver reads to choose `<video>` over
 *   `<img>`. A missing one is repaired by sniffing the stored bytes, exactly as the admin Media
 *   list's read-path backfill does (`routes/media/content-type.ts`), so a row published by an older
 *   build heals the next time a run carries it, even `unchanged`;
 * - every other media its `htmlAttributes` names by `/m/{key}/` URL (a video's `poster`) exists here.
 *
 * Cheap by design: point lookups per item, one batched type read, and a blob read only for the
 * (normally zero) items missing a type. Image renditions are NOT decoded here — they are generated on
 * first request, and proving one decodes would mean running the image transformer per item.
