/**
 * @file `hydrateBlobStoreFromSeed()` — fills in stock blob BYTES for `asset_blobs` rows a fresh
 * site inherited from `content.seed.db` (see `hydrate-content-db-from-seed.ts`'s header for that
 * half of the pair).
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The gap this closes
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `npm run seed:site` prunes and ships `content.seed.db` — including `media`/`asset_blobs` rows,
 * neither of which is in `seed-site.mjs`'s `PRUNE_TABLES` list. `hydrateContentDbFromSeed()` then
 * copies those rows into a fresh deploy's `content.db` on first boot. Nothing analogous ever
 * shipped the BYTES those rows' `storage_key`s point at: the Dockerfile's build stage previously
 * extracted only `content.seed.db` before `RUN rm -rf sites` wiped the whole `sites/` tree (which
 * is where `uploads/` — and therefore every blob's bytes — actually lives). Confirmed live on
 * `tovu.fly.dev/admin/media`: real `media`/`asset_blobs` rows, zero corresponding files, every
 * preview 500s and falls back to the placeholder icon. This function is the missing other half —
 * same "read-only stock source shipped in the image, copied into the site's own mutable copy"
 * shape `seedSiteThemes()` and `hydrateContentDbFromSeed()` already use for `themes/` and
 * `content.db`. The Dockerfile's own build stage now stages the matching `uploads/` payload
 * alongside `content.seed.db` (see that file's comment at the extraction loop) — this function is
 * the boot-time consumer of that payload.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this does NOT reuse either sibling's "whole-thing presence" gate
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `hydrateContentDbFromSeed()` gates on one file's existence; `seedSiteThemes()` gates on one
 * directory's existence — both correct for a THING that is copied once, as a single unit, and never
 * partially seeded again. `uploads/` is not that shape: it is a content-addressed, ever-growing SET
 * of independent files that real usage adds to throughout a site's life, and — the reason this
 * function exists at all — it may already hold real files (from a boot before this function
 * existed, or from ordinary use) by the time this code ships. A whole-directory presence gate would
 * make the fix's own effect depend on incidental state this code has no way to inspect (does
 * `uploads/` already exist for some unrelated reason?) and could silently leave THIS EXACT bug
 * unfixed on the very deploy meant to fix it. So the gate here applies the same underlying rule —
 * never touch something that might already be real, only fill in what is provably absent — at the
 * store's actual unit of identity: one content-addressed key at a time, via `BlobStorePort
 * .putIfAbsent()`. An existing key, however it got there, is left exactly as it is; only a key
 * genuinely missing from the live store gets written. This also means the function is safe to run
 * on EVERY boot, not just a first one: every call after the first is an all-`skipped` no-op once
 * the store catches up.
 *
 * This used to be a separate `exists()` check followed by a separate `put()` — a check-then-act
 * pair with a real TOCTOU gap: a real uploader's write landing in that gap got silently overwritten
 * by this function's stock seed bytes. `putIfAbsent()` collapses the two into one call the adapter
 * itself makes atomic (`LocalFsBlobStore`'s `"wx"` open flag; `S3BlobStore`'s conditional
 * `If-None-Match` PUT — see each adapter's own doc), closing the gap outright rather than narrowing
 * it. Safe to do unconditionally specifically because this store is content-addressed: whichever
 * writer's bytes end up stored for a given key, they are — short of a sha256 collision — the same
 * bytes any other writer for that key would have written; `putIfAbsent` only needs to guarantee no
 * concurrent writer's write gets torn or clobbered, not that this function's copy "wins".
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this goes through `BlobStorePort`, not a filesystem copy
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The SOURCE (the seed payload the image ships) is always a plain directory — that's how the
 * Dockerfile stages it, mirroring `content.seed.db`'s own extraction. The DESTINATION is whatever
 * `resolveBlobStore()` resolved for this deployment: `LocalFsBlobStore` today, or `S3BlobStore` for
 * any operator who sets `TOVU_MEDIA_BLOB_STORE=s3`. Writing straight to a filesystem path would
 * silently stop working — with no error, just permanently-missing bytes on the very backend this
 * fix exists to protect against — the moment an operator makes that switch. Going through
 * `blobStore.putIfAbsent()` instead means this function needs no change at all if the backend
 * changes: same one call, whichever `BlobStorePort` implementation `deps.ts` handed it.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Fire-and-forget async boot effect (unlike its two sync siblings above — `BlobStorePort` itself is
 * async), wired the same way `media/bootstrap.ts`'s `ensureCoreMediaTransform` chain is in
 * `deps.ts`: does not gate any request, and its caller logs-and-swallows failure so one bad seed
 * file can never fail boot. Pure filesystem-read + port-write effect, no domain logic of its own.
