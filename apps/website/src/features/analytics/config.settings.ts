/**
 * @file Boot-time `core.analytics.*` setting-definition registration plus the
 * `AnalyticsConfigPort` adapter that reads them back — the ADR-028 wiring
 * `server/app.ts`'s former inline stub named as still-owed ("Real config
 * should be backed by ADR-028 settings once that wiring exists"). Mirrors
 * `assistant/execution-mode-settings.ts`'s shape (definitions + registrar +
 * factory in one file); see that file for the worked example this one
 * follows.
 *
 * OWNER KIND: `core`, not `site`. This is first-party analytics
 * COLLECTION policy (whether/how the operator's own site gathers visitor
 * data) — a platform-level capability, same category as
 * `core.execution.*` — not per-site CONTENT, so `workspaceId: null` at the
 * DEFINITION level (`ensureSettingDefinitions`'s namespace-fence
 * requirement), while `scopes: SCOPE_BIT.workspace` (the shared default)
 * still lets each workspace hold its own VALUE row.
 *
 * NOT the same thing as `core.privacy.telemetry.*`
 * (`features/settings/ui-tab-definitions.ts`): that pair is VENDOR
 * telemetry consent (share anonymous usage data with the vendor via a
 * `ForwardingSink`-shaped path) and has no adapter to gate — Tovu has no
 * outbound telemetry sink at all yet. This namespace is the operator's own
 * first-party visitor analytics (pageviews, the operator's own dashboard),
 * gated on THESE settings, never on vendor consent.
 *
 * `sink` KEY (2026-10-21). Until vendor forwarding existed no `sink` key was
 * registered, deliberately: exposing it would have let an operator select an
 * adapter that cannot be constructed (this project's standing rule against
 * controls that lie about what they do). It lands now together with a
 * constructible path — the keyed `@jini-ai/analytics` forwarder registry and
 * its plugin loader (`.cloud-coord/analytics-DESIGN.md`). `"local"` (default)
 * means the built-in sink only; any other value names a forwarder that
 * receives hits IN ADDITION to the built-in sink, and an id that is not
 * installed falls back to built-in only (fail toward not sending data).
 *
 * ADR-PIPE-008 DISCLOSURE (`features/settings/types.ts`'s `SettingValueSchema`
 * doc comment): `{type:"json"}` was, until this file, used exactly once in
 * the codebase (`site.seo.robots_rules`), and that comment plus
 * `execution-mode-settings.ts`'s `localCli.model` comment both said so in
 * the singular. `excludedPaths`/`excludedIpRanges` below are a second and
 * third use — deliberately, not by oversight: both are genuinely
 * unbounded, list-shaped data (path globs / IP ranges) with no scalar
 * decomposition available, the same category `robots_rules` itself is the
 * precedent for, not the "scalar field encoded as JSON to skip
 * decomposition work" pattern the rule exists to block. Both stale
 * "exactly one" comments have been corrected alongside this file landing
 * (see `features/settings/types.ts` and `execution-mode-settings.ts`) so no
 * comment in the codebase asserts a count this change makes false. Flagged
 * here for Code Review per ADR-PIPE-008 Enforcement's own instruction.
