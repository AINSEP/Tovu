/**
 * @file The `content-duplication` domain's agent-tool catalog — ONE tool, `content_duplicate`,
 * generic over a `resource` parameter rather than one bespoke `*_duplicate` tool per resource.
 *
 * Owner's explicit design correction (`ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-07-page-tool-gap.md`'s follow-up,
 * her own words): *"if we had, like, a copy tool and then we could pass arguments to copy a post,
 * copy a media provider, copy a form… We're not collapsing a bunch of tools into one thing. We are
 * having, like, a category of a tool and then having it flexible enough to do multiple things, like
 * copying different things."* The transpose of merging verbs-per-entity (which the coverage audit's
 * `comments_*` finding correctly flags as a bad merge — different VERBS sharing one permission):
 * this is ONE verb (`duplicate`) generic over resource, with permission resolved PER resource, never
 * a single flat permission for the whole tool. See `tool-registrations.ts`'s own header for how.
 *
 * `resource` is deliberately NOT a closed enum here: the set of duplicable resources grows as more
 * features register into `assistant/duplicate-resource-registry.ts` (today: `post`, `page`, `form`;
 * the coverage audit named `collections/entries`, `media`, `redirects`, `taxonomy terms`, and
 * `menus` as the same gap, not yet wired — `widgets` is deliberately NOT on that path: a widget
 * instance is meant to be SHARED across documents, so "copy a widget" is an open product question,
 * not a wiring gap). A static JSON-Schema enum authored
 * once at module load could not reflect a registry populated at boot, so an unsupported `resource`
 * is instead rejected at CALL time with the live, enumerated list of what IS supported — see
 * `tool-registrations.ts`'s handler.

      "Creates a copy of an existing resource — a post, a page, a form, a media asset, and (as more resource " +
      "types are wired) other content this workspace holds. The tool for 'copy X and name it Y', 'duplicate this " +
      "page', or 'use this as a starting point for a new one'. One call: reads the source, then creates a new one " +
      "with a fresh id, never touching the source. " +
      "resource names WHICH kind of thing to copy — currently 'post', 'page', 'form', or 'media'. An unrecognized " +
      "resource is rejected with the exact list of resources this workspace currently supports; if what you need " +
      "is not on that list, this tool cannot copy it yet and no spelling of it will work. " +
      "id is the source resource's own id (for post/page, as returned by content_post_list/content_post_get; for " +
      "form, as returned by forms_list_definitions; for media, as returned by media_list_assets — a media slug " +
      "works there too). " +
      "overrides carries optional fields for the copy — title, slug, status — and not every resource type honors " +
      "every field; a resource rejects an override it cannot honor rather than ignoring it. " +
      "For post/page: title defaults to 'Copy of <source title>'; slug defaults to a fresh one derived from that " +
      "title; status ALWAYS defaults to 'draft' even when the source is published — a copy must never silently go " +
      "live unless you explicitly override it. " +
      "For form: title is the copy's NAME and defaults to 'Copy of <source name>'; slug defaults to a fresh one " +
      "derived from it; every field and the notify config are copied; status is NOT accepted (a form is " +
      "active/disabled, not draft/published — the copy inherits the source's own state, so a copy of a disabled " +
      "form is disabled; use forms_set_definition_status to change it). " +
      "For media: you get a NEW LIBRARY ENTRY POINTING AT THE SAME FILE, not a second copy of the file. The copy " +
      "has its own id, slug, title, alt text, caption, credit, width/height, CSS class and HTML attributes — all " +
      "seeded from the source and independently editable afterwards — but the underlying image or video bytes are " +
      "shared, because media storage is content-addressed and identical bytes are always one stored object. " +
      "Deleting one of the two does not break the other. Use it when you want the same picture described or sized " +
      "differently in a different place; it will NOT give you a separate file to alter independently. A trashed " +
      "asset is refused rather than copied, and status is NOT accepted (media is active/trashed; a copy is always " +
      "created active — use media_trash_asset afterwards). " +
      "Permission to duplicate is resolved from the RESOURCE you named, not one flat grant for this whole tool: " +
