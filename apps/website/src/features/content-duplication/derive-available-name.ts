/**
 * @file Resource-agnostic naming policy for `content_duplicate`'s DEFAULT copy name — shared by
 * post/page, form, and media. None of their repo ports has a `findByTitle` lookup (only
 * `findById`/`findBySlug`/`list` — confirmed by reading `PostRepoPort`, `FormDefinitionRepoPort`, and
 * `MediaRepoPort` directly), so every caller of {@link deriveDuplicateName} answers `isTaken` with an
 * O(n) `list()` scan. That is a deliberate, RECORDED scale-bounded choice, not something slipped in:
 * at current scale (read live, 2026-09-08) this workspace holds 78 pages, 64 posts, 3 forms, and 17
 * media rows. Adding a `findByTitle` port method to three domains was explicitly out of scope for
 * this change; revisit this file if any of those counts grows into the thousands.
 *
 * ## The owner's ruling this file implements (2026-09-08)
 *
 * A copy with no name given is an exact copy of the source except for its name (and slug, which
 * follows the name for post/page and form — see each resource's own duplicate handler), which gets a
 * numeric suffix: `Landing sample — xai` -> `Landing sample — xai 2`; copy again -> `... 3`. Never
 * `Copy of ...`, which produces `Copy of Copy of X` on a second copy and is untranslatable.
 *
 * ## `deriveAvailableName` — the collision-search loop
 *
 * Generalizes `features/forms/duplicate-slug.ts`'s `deriveAvailableFormSlug` loop (bounded suffix
 * search, an injected `isTaken`, a BASE that shrinks to make room for the suffix rather than the
 * suffix itself) so the one loop is shared rather than reinvented for names: `deriveAvailableFormSlug`
 * now delegates here for its own hyphenated, length-capped slug search (see that file), and every
 * `content_duplicate` resource handler calls it directly (via {@link deriveDuplicateName} below) for
 * the plain, space-suffixed NAME search this file's header describes.
 *
 * ## `deriveDuplicateName` — the trailing-number rule
 *
 * A trailing integer already on the source's own name is read as an existing copy counter — and so
 * is stripped before searching from it — ONLY when the stripped base itself already exists as a name
 * in the same resource (that is the evidence it really is a copy counter, not part of the name).
 * `Landing 2` increments to `Landing 3` only if something named `Landing` exists. `Blog 2024` with no
 * `Blog` row becomes `Blog 2024 2`, because `2024` is read from the data as part of the name, never
 * guessed at from the number's own magnitude.
 *
 * Tovu supplies the suffix/collision policy, limit and wording to Jini/packages/core/src/naming.ts;
 * the collision loop and generic trailing-number rationale live there.
 *
 * Suffix formatting and counter evidence:
 *
 * {@link deriveAvailableName}'s default `withSuffix`: a plain space then the number, matching the
 *  owner's own examples (`"Landing sample — xai 2"`) — never a hyphen or a parenthesis.
 *
 * Matches a name ending in a space then one or more digits, capturing the part before it — e.g.
 * `"Landing 2"` -> `["Landing 2", "Landing"]`. Requires at least one non-space character immediately
 * before the space, so a bare `"2"` (nothing to strip) does not match.
