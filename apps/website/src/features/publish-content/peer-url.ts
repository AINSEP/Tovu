/**
 * @file Task 10 of the publish-content (Publish Content) feature —
 * `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-18-publish-feature-implementation-plan.md` §4 task 10.
 *
 * `baseUrl` validation for a `publish_content_peers` row — "a Tovu at a URL", which is the whole of
 * a peer's identity (plan §0b: never a platform identifier such as an app name, project id or
 * region, because those are Fly/Railway/Render-shaped and this feature must work on all of them and
 * on a bare VPS).
 *
 * Deliberately modelled on `features/origin/configured-origin.ts`'s refusal pipeline, and reusing
 * its exported {@link hasForbiddenRawUrlCharacter} rather than re-deriving the raw-character class
 * (a backslash becomes a slash and whitespace is stripped once `new URL()` has run, so the check
 * has to happen on the raw string). Same refusals for the same reasons: non-https, userinfo,
 * query/fragment, control characters, empty host.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE DIFFERENCE, and it is load-bearing: `configured-origin.ts` refuses a LOOPBACK host,
 * because a loopback address can never be this deployment's own PUBLIC origin. A peer is the
 * opposite kind of thing — it is a host this process dials OUT to, and a legitimate peer may well
 * sit on a private network: Railway and Render both give services internal DNS names, AWS puts them
 * in a VPC, and a bare VPS may run two Tovus behind one firewall. Refusing private addresses here
 * would make this feature Fly-shaped (public-internet-only) in exactly the way plan §0b forbids.
 *
 * The private-address decision therefore belongs to the ONE place that already owns it — ADR-038's
 * `EgressPolicy.denyPrivateAddresses` plus its named `devHostAllowlist` capability, enforced in
 * `platform/http/client.ts` against the RESOLVED address, not against a hostname pattern. A peer at
 * a private address is accepted here and refused at send time with a diagnosis that names
 * `devHostAllowlist` (`peer-transport.ts`'s `describePeerEgressRefusal`).
 *
 * `https` stays HARD required, on every host including loopback: the peer credential travels as a
 * bearer `Authorization` header on every request, and the peer egress policy's `allowedSchemes` is
 * `["https"]` so this is a structural property, not just this validator's opinion.
