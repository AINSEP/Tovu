/**
 * @file `publish-files-plan-2026-09-24.md` §3 — the process-wide address book a file-tree `pack()`
 * (today only `features/theme/publish-content.ts`'s theme walker) fills as it hashes files on disk,
 * so a PUSH or a PULL can later hand those exact bytes to a peer WITHOUT copying them into the media
 * blob store first. `composite-blob-source.ts` is the one reader; this module owns only the mapping
 * and its bound.
 *
 * ## Why an LRU, not an unbounded map
 *
 * The index is filled by every `pack()` call this process makes for the lifetime of the process
 * (never cleared between requests — {@link CreatePublishContentApplyPort}'s siblings all follow this
 * "one shared, process-lifetime instance" convention already, see `routes/types.ts`'s
 * `publishContentBundleRepo` doc for the identical reasoning applied to a different singleton). A
 * site with many themes, repeatedly re-packed across many admin sessions, would otherwise grow this
 * map without bound. Capping it at {@link FILE_BLOB_INDEX_MAX_ENTRIES} and evicting the
 * least-recently-touched entry keeps memory bounded while keeping the entries a caller is actually
 * about to use (the ones from the MOST RECENT `pack()`) resident.
 *
 * ## Why "recently touched" includes reads, not just inserts
 *
 * A `pack()` that runs again soon after (an operator re-opening the publish dialog) re-inserts the
 * same shas and bumps them for free. What an LRU protects against is a *read* pattern: a peer pulling
 * many blobs in one push touches the same recently-packed entries repeatedly, and those reads should
 * count as "still useful" exactly as much as the insert that created them did — otherwise a export
 * with more distinct blobs than the cap could evict an entry between two reads of it within the same
 * push. {@link FileBlobIndexPort.get} therefore bumps recency on every hit.
 */

/** One packed file's location on this machine and its size — never its bytes; a caller re-reads and
 *  re-hashes them at the moment it actually needs them ({@link ../composite-blob-source.ts}'s own
 *  doc explains why a cached read would be unsafe here). */

 * Backed by a `Map`: insertion order in a JS `Map` already IS recency order for this module's
 * purposes, because every {@link FileBlobIndexPort.get}/`.set` on an existing key re-inserts that key
 * (delete-then-set), which moves it to the end of the map's own iteration order. The least-recently-

 *   always-empty index.
