/**
 * @file Publishing readiness, connection, and human-confirmed pulls from the live site.
 *
 * ## Why readiness and connection are separate
 *
 * The owner's requirement was "it should be automatic, discoverable by AI, and a regular user
 * doesn't have to think about it". "Discoverable" is the part a single tool cannot deliver: a model
 * that can only act has no way to answer "can I publish?" without attempting it, so the honest
 * answer to a person asking "is my site set up?" would be a failed attempt. So the read comes first
 * and stands alone, and the repair is its own verb.
 *
 * ## Why there is no `publish_content_publish` here
 *
 * `ADS-memory/.local-artifacts/publish-criteria-tool-webmcp-plan-2026-09-24.md` §0 deleted it. There
 * is now exactly one publish surface, the admin **Publish dialog**, and the chat assistant reaches it
 * through the `admin.publish_content` capability (`ui/criteria.ts`) rather than through a chat tool
 * of its own — see that plan and `tool-registrations.ts`'s header for why.
 *
 * ## The vocabulary rule
 *
 * The DESCRIPTIONS below are read by the model and may name mechanism. The status/connect tools'
 * returned sentences are read by a person and must avoid: no key, token, grant, principal, capability, workspace
 * id, installation id, generation, peer or bundle, and no error codes.
 * Pull tools return structured plan/report fields for the model.
 * `__tests__/publish-agent-tools.test.ts` asserts that over every reachable sentence rather
 * than trusting review — the same guard `publish-trust/__tests__/provisioning.test.ts` already
 * applies to its own refusals.
