/**
 * @file "Is publishing set up for this site?", answered in sentences a person who has never heard
 * the word *key* can read.
 *
 * ## Why this is a pure function with no I/O
 *
 * Multiple callers want the same answer and must not each invent their own wording: the assistant's
 * `publish_content_status` tool, and the Publish dialog's own empty state.
 * Every input below is a fact one repo read or one table read already produces, so keeping the
 * decision pure means the wording is directly assertable — including the property that matters most
 * here, which is that no string it can produce teaches a concept.
 *
 * ## The vocabulary rule, stated as a rule
 *
 * Nothing in this file may name a key, a token, a grant, a principal, a capability, a workspace id,
 * an installation id, a generation, a peer, or a bundle. Not because those are secret — most are in
 * committed config — but because naming them is the vocabulary lesson the whole zero-setup design
 * exists to avoid (`features/publish-trust/connect.ts`'s header; the owner rejected the key ceremony
 * five times). `__tests__/publish-readiness.test.ts` asserts it over every reachable sentence rather
 * than trusting review, mirroring `publish-trust/__tests__/provisioning.test.ts`'s identical guard.
 *
 * ## "Never connected" is an empty state, not a fault
 *
 * A fresh install that has never been deployed has nowhere to publish to. That is the ordinary first
 * run. It gets a plain sentence and a next step, never an error and never a code.
 */

/**
 * The four situations a source install can be in. Deliberately coarse: a person does not need four
 * shades of "not set up", they need to know whether it works and what to do if it does not.
