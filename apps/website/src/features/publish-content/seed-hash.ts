/**
 * @file D1 (2026-09-24 owner decision, publish-types-plan §6) — the "seed version" of a destination
 * row, the virtual baseline `planner.ts` (`PlanImportDeps.getSeedHash`) and `apply-loop.ts` fall
 * back to when no `publish_content_baselines` row exists yet.
 *
 * Where it runs: on the DESTINATION. `planImport()` and the apply loop both run on the instance that
 * receives the bundle, so "what did this row look like when this instance was first hydrated" is a
 * question only the destination can answer — and it can, because the stock seed it hydrated from
 * ships inside its own image (`builtInContentSeedDbPath()`, `hydrate-content-db-from-seed.ts`).
 *
 * How the hash is obtained: every registered contributor is built against a `PublishContentDeps`
 * whose repos read the SEED database instead of the live one, and its ordinary `inspect(id)` answers.
 * That is the same projection and the same `contentHash()` the live row is inspected through, so the
 * two hashes are comparable by construction — no second hashing path that could drift.
 *
 * Fail-safe: any miss (no seed shipped, entity absent from the seed, type absent, the seed failing
 * to open) answers `null`, which the planner reads as "no seed baseline" — the unchanged, pre-D1
 * `conflict`. This lookup can only ever turn a conflict into an overwrite when the destination row
 * is byte-for-byte what the seed put there.
