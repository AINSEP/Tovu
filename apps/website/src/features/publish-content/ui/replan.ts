 * plan matters after a mismatch: the operator has been told to check the new list, and every later
 * tick would otherwise re-report the same old drift forever (c7n-ow-review2, 2026-09-24).
 *
 * Two things must both hold:
 * 1. every ticked key is now `forced` in `next` — a peer that can honour the overwrite always
 *    answers this way; anything else means the tick did not take (e.g. the holder moved again).
 * 2. every writing row (created/applied/forced) outside `changing` — the keys ticked or unticked by
 *    this click and any still in flight — names the exact same set in both reports: a live edit
 *    landing in between shows up here as a newly-written or newly-skipped row.
 *
 * A `false` here is not a network error: the re-plan itself succeeded, it just disagrees with what
 * was on screen, and `applyOverwriteKeys` shows the new truth plus a sentence rather than silently
 * keeping the stale one.
 *
 * @complexity O(n) in the larger report's row count.
