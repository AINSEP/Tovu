/**
 * @file Task 6 of the publish-content (Publish Content) feature —
 * `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-18-publish-feature-implementation-plan.md` §2 (`publish_content_
 * bundles`) / §4 task 6.
 *
 * A received bundle (Task 4's export envelope: `{hashVersion, sourceLabel, entities, blobManifest}`)
 * is staged here, between the peer's push/pull and Task 7's gated `plan()`/`execute()`, so the plan
 * hash has a stable input and large media bytes upload exactly once (schema doc, `platform/db/
 * schema.ts`'s `publishContentBundles`). Bytes are NOT stored here — see `blob-staging.ts`.
 *
 * `expiresAt` is ALWAYS computed here, server-side, from `receivedAt` + a fixed TTL — never accepted
 * from the caller. A client-controlled expiry would let a peer stage a bundle that never expires
 * (plan §5 risk #13: "a staged bundle accumulating unbounded").
 *
 * **Deviation from the plan's draft schema (disclosed):** plan §2's `publish_content_bundles`
 * draft included a `sourceLabel`/label-style column; the migration Task 3 actually landed
 * (`platform/db/schema.ts`'s `publishContentBundles`, migration `0066`) has NO such column — only
 * `id`/`workspaceId`/`sourcePrincipalId`/`hashVersion`/`entitiesJson`/`blobManifestJson`/`sizeBytes`/
 * `receivedAt`/`expiresAt`. This module accepts an optional `sourceLabel` on {@link StageBundleInput}
 * (the export envelope carries one) but does NOT persist it — it is display-only and, per
 * `publishContentRuns.peerLabel`'s own doc, "never used in any comparison or trust decision", so
 * dropping it here costs nothing safety-relevant. Task 7's `planImport` already treats
 * `PublishContentBundle.sourceLabel` as optional. Not fixed by editing the migration: out of this task's
 * scope (already-landed schema/migration files) — flagged in this task's handoff instead.
 *
 * ## Why "past `expiresAt`" is a REPO-level concept, not just an HTTP one
 *
 * Task 6 ships no HTTP route that reads a staged bundle back (that is Task 7's `plan()` — plan
 * §4's own task table has Task 7 depend on Task 6, not the reverse). {@link loadActiveBundle} is
 * still built and tested here, not deferred to Task 7, for the same reason `isRedeemable` lives in
 * `token.ts` next to `mintToken` rather than in the gateway that later calls it: the expiry rule is
 * a property of the bundle's own lifecycle, directly testable against an in-memory repo without any
 * gated-mutation machinery, and Task 7 must get it for free rather than re-deriving the same
 * boundary check against the same column a second time.
