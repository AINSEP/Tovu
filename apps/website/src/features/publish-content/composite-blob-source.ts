/**
 * @file `publish-files-plan-2026-09-24.md` §3 — the composite {@link PeerBlobSource} a file-tree type
 * (`theme-files` today) needs on both legs a blob can travel by: the PUSH driver
 * (`pushBundleToPeer`, `peer-transport.ts`) reads a source blob to upload it; the destination's own
 * `GET .../blobs/:sha` route (`routes/publish-content/blob-get.ts`) reads a source blob to SERVE it to
 * a pulling peer. Neither call site knows or cares whether a sha's bytes live in the media blob store
 * (a `post`/`page`/`media` entity's blobs) or only on disk inside a theme's own tree
 * (`FileBlobIndexPort`, filled by `features/theme/publish-content.ts`'s `pack()`) — this module is
 * what makes that distinction invisible to both of them, checking the blob store FIRST (the common,
 * cheaper case for every pre-existing type) and falling back to the file index only when the store
 * does not have it.
 *
 * ## Why bytes are re-hashed here rather than trusted from `pack()`
 *
 * `FileBlobIndexEntry` records only a path and a size — never the bytes, and never a "this file is
 * still exactly what it was when packed" guarantee. Time passes between a `pack()` call (an operator
 * opening the publish dialog) and a peer actually fetching a blob (after confirming a plan, possibly
 * minutes later); the file on disk could have been edited, replaced, or deleted in between by the
 * SAME author working on their theme in an editor. Re-hashing at read time, and refusing to serve
 * bytes that no longer match the sha they are addressed by, is what keeps this source honest to the
 * content-addressed contract every other blob in this feature already holds: the sha IS the identity,
 * so bytes that don't hash to it are not "the blob some caller asked for", they are stale or wrong
 * data that happens to still sit at the recorded path.
 *
 * ## Why the check lives in `exists()`, not only in `get()`
 *
 * Both call sites above gate a `get()` behind an `exists()` check first (this module's whole point is
 * to make that existing two-step shape work for a file-index-backed blob too, with no call-site
 * change). If `exists()` only checked "is there a `FileBlobIndexEntry`" without verifying the bytes,
 * a caller would see `exists() -> true` and then have `get()` throw for a file that changed underneath
 * it — turning an ordinary "the file moved on" case into an unhandled exception neither call site
 * catches today (`pushBundleToPeer`'s own blob loop has no `try/catch` around its `get()` call, and
 * nor does `blob-get.ts`). Doing the full read-and-hash inside `exists()` too means a changed or
 * missing file answers `false`, which both callers already treat as "unavailable" — see
 * `blobsUnavailable`/`404 BLOB_NOT_FOUND` at each site — with no call-site change required.
 * `get()` re-verifies independently anyway (this file's own header) rather than trusting a same-tick
 * `exists()` call, so a TOCTOU race between the two still fails CLOSED (a thrown error, never a
 * silent return of wrong bytes) instead of relying on caller discipline to always check first.
 */

/** Thrown by {@link createCompositePeerBlobSource}'s `get()` only in the TOCTOU window between an
 *  `exists()` check and this call — every call site gates on `exists()` first, so this is a rare
 *  defensive backstop, never the documented "unavailable" path (that is `exists()` returning `false`,
 *  which every caller already treats as ordinary). Not caught anywhere by design: a genuine race this
 *  narrow is exceptional enough that surfacing it as a hard failure is more honest than silently
 *  reporting the blob as merely absent. */
