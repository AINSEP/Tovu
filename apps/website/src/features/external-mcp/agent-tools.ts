/**
 * @file The External MCP domain's agent-tool catalog (SPEC-016 REQ-22 naming/callability
 * convention — the same shape `features/site-inspection/agent-tools.ts` and every other domain
 * catalog already use).
 *
 * ## Why this domain exists
 *
 * The owner's ask: a non-technical site owner should be able to type "connect me to Higgsfield"
 * into the admin assistant chat and have the agent configure the external MCP server itself,
 * asking only for what it genuinely cannot know. Settings → External MCP (the admin form,
 * `apps/admin/src/features/settings/ExternalMcpSettingsPanel.tsx`) already lets a human do this by
 * hand; these five tools are the same capability, reachable by the agent.
 *
 * ## Five tools, not one CRUD tool per field
 *
 * - `content_read.external_mcp` — read. What is configured, never a secret value.
 * - `external_mcp_save` — the ONE write tool for both "add a new server" and "update an existing
 *   one". Mirrors `saveExternalMcpServer`'s own idempotent-by-id PUT design (`src/assistant/
 *   external-mcp-store.ts`'s own doc: "two routes would be two validators of one contract") — the
 *   same reasoning applies one layer up: two tools would be two validators of one contract, and an
 *   agent updating a server it just created would have to remember which tool it used the first
 *   time. HUMAN-CONFIRMED: this never writes silently. See `tool-registrations.ts`'s handler.
 * - `external_mcp_test_connection` — read-only. Reports whether an ALREADY-SAVED server's
 *   configuration resolves cleanly (decrypts, has everything its transport needs, isn't sitting on
 *   an expired OAuth grant) — see that tool's own description for exactly what it does and does not
 *   check.
 * - `external_mcp_oauth_connect` / `external_mcp_oauth_poll_device` — the two moves the hard
 *   constraint "the agent's job ends at handing over one link and then detecting completion"
 *   requires: start an authorization and hand back the one thing a human needs (a link, or a device
 *   code), and — for the device-code grant specifically, which has no callback of its own — poll it
 *   once per call so completion can be detected without inventing a script the model would loop on
 *   its own. For the browser-redirect grant, completion is detected simply by calling
 *   `content_read.external_mcp` again and reading `oauth.status`.
 *
 * ## What no tool here ever accepts as input
 *
 * `env` (the stdio credential block) and `oauthClientSecret` are absent from every input schema
 * below, on purpose, not by omission. A tool argument is text the model chose to write, and — same
 * as `deployment_propose_custom_provider_credential`'s identical rule — a secret typed into a tool
 * call is a secret written into the conversation transcript. Every secret field is entered by the
 * HUMAN directly into the confirmation form `external_mcp_save` renders; the agent never sees or
 * handles it (see `save-form.ts`). `additionalProperties: false` on `external_mcp_save`'s schema
 * makes an attempt to pass one a loud, rejected call rather than a silently dropped field.
 */

 *  `WirableToolDefinition`'s doc in `@jini-ai/cms/core` for why a shared import is deliberately not

/**
 * The same site-owner-level permission the HTTP routes gate on (`server/routes/admin/external-mcp/
 * guard.ts`) — restated rather than imported because that module lives under `server/routes/`, a
 * direction this domain does not import from (see `deps.ts`'s own header). Reusing the STRING is
 * what keeps the two gates from drifting, which is the property that module's own doc calls
 * load-bearing: a stored row's `command` is spawned as a real child process at daemon boot, so
 * whoever can write here can execute arbitrary code as the Tovu process — exactly as consequential
 * through a chat message as through a form submission, and the gate must not be weaker for one path
 * than the other.
