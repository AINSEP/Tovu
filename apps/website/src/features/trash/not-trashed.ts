/**
 * @file The one read rule every trashable domain's queries add: "this row is not currently in the
 * Trash." Two forms of the same rule — {@link notTrashed} for a SQL `WHERE`, {@link isTrashedRecord}
 * for an in-memory record — so a SQLite/Postgres repo and its in-memory test double agree without
 * either one re-deriving the rule from `entityType` itself.
 *
 * `term`'s `hiddenWithParent` (T1 item 3, `registry.ts`'s `TrashHiddenWithParentSpec`): a term is
 * trashed the moment its taxonomy is, with no second write and no cascade-hide of every member term.
 * {@link notTrashed} ANDs in a `NOT EXISTS` over the parent table, built from registry names only
 * (never caller input), so a term reads as trashed the instant its taxonomy does, with no extra write
 * to keep in sync. {@link isTrashedRecord} — the in-memory twin, used by record-store doubles and
 * hermetic test repos — CANNOT evaluate this: a flat record has no parent row to join against. It
 * reports the entity's own marker only; a term entity whose taxonomy is trashed reads as live through
 * this path until a caller with a real parent lookup (T6's own domain repo) filters it separately.
