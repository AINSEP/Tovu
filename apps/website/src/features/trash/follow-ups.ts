/**
 * @file `withFollowUps` — lets one Trash type finish a hide, restore or purge its own generic marker
 * flip cannot express, without teaching the generic table adapter anything about that type. T1's
 * generalization of the A0 `withRestoreFollowUp` sketch (plan §2 T1 item 6) into one decorator with
 * three optional hooks, so T5/T6 (menus, terms, taxonomies) register their own event/revision
 * follow-ups the same way `widget` already does, rather than each writing a bespoke wrapper.
 *
 * Every hook:
 *  - runs inside the op's own transaction — `TrashPort.trash`/`restore`/`purgeSelected` (`write-
 *    service.ts`) already wrap the adapter call in `deps.transaction`, and this decorator's hooks run
 *    from inside that same call, so a hook backed by the same `ContentDb`/`db.$client` connection
 *    joins it automatically (reentrant, see `db-port.sqlite.ts`'s doc);
 *  - runs only on an OK/`"purged"` result — a no-op outcome (`not-found`, `version-changed`,
 *    `blocked`, `already-gone`) never fires one, because nothing changed;
 *  - propagates a throw, which rolls the whole op back (the state change and the hook are one unit).
 *
 * `afterPurge` is paired with `beforePurge`: the row is gone the instant `purge` reports `"purged"`
 * (a DELETE is visible to later reads in the SAME transaction even before COMMIT), so anything a
 * purge hook needs to see about the row's pre-purge state (a taxonomy revision's
 * `previousStateJson`) has to be read BEFORE the delete runs. `beforePurge`'s return value is handed
 * back to `afterPurge` untouched — this file never interprets it, keeping every hook's own shape a
 * type-specific concern for its caller in `deps.ts`, not for `features/trash`.
