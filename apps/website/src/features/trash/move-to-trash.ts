/**
 * @file `moveToTrash` — the ONE generic delete `POST /trash/items` (and, later, every per-domain
 * Delete button except Posts) calls into, for any kind registered in `TRASHABLE`. Design of record:
 * `ADS-memory/.local-artifacts/handoffs/2026-09-21-t8f-trash-more-plan.md` §3.
 *
 * This is deliberately a thin read-then-write, not a second place that decides what "trashed" means:
 * the marker flip and the `trashed_items` insert still happen inside `TrashPort.trash`
 * (`@jini-ai/cms/trash`), one transaction, exactly as every bespoke `remove*` path already works. What
 * this file adds is the part a bespoke `remove*` binding does not need — resolving WHICH kind, WHICH
 * permission and WHICH row, generically, from `TRASHABLE` alone, so a new registry entry needs no new
 * route and no new binding.
 *
 * Every outcome is a typed result, never a thrown error — same convention as `TrashMarkerResult`/
 * `RestoreOutcome`/`TrashPurgeOutcome` elsewhere in this feature, so the route (`routes/trash/
 * items.ts`) maps outcomes to status codes without a try/catch around a business decision.
