 * Narrows `bindRemoveEntity`'s result for a type whose registry entry declares no `blocker`

 * `TrashMarkerResult` (T1) is generic over every registered kind, so TypeScript cannot see that on
 * its own; this is the composition-root seam that carries the narrower promise those domains'
 * OWN structural types (`RemoveRedirectFn`/`RemoveCommentFn`/`RemoveFormSubmissionFn`) still make.
 * A `"blocked"` result here is a composition bug (a blocker was added to one of these three entries
 * without updating this call site to match) — fail fast rather than silently drop it.
 *
 * Shared by both composition roots (`server/runtime/composition`'s `app.ts` and `deps.ts`) and by
 * the tests that wire a blocker-free removal, so a test never carries its own drifting twin.
 *
 * @param required.remove the bound trash removal (`bindRemoveEntity`/`bindWidgetRemoval`, or a test
 *   double over an adapter's `hide`).
 * @returns the same removal, typed as the domain port's narrower result.
 * @throws Error when `remove` answers `"blocked"`.
 * @complexity O(1) beyond `remove` itself.
