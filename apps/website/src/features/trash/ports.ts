/**
 * @file Port contracts for the local admin Trash (phase 1 — Posts, Comments, Media, Redirects).
 *
 * Design of record: `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-20-trash-delete-architecture.md`. Read §1.1 before
 * changing anything here: the whole shape exists so that **a trash operation never round-trips the
 * entity payload, and listing the trash never reads the entity at all**. `widgets_trash_instance`
 * is the counter-example — it parses `fields_json` to flip a status, so it fails on exactly the
 * corrupt rows a user most wants gone.
 *
 * Two structural rules this file encodes by signature rather than by discipline:
 *
 *  1. `TrashPort.trash` takes `display` as a REQUIRED argument. The caller already holds the record
 *     (it loaded it for its own permission/version checks), so the snapshot comes from columns it
 *     has in hand. The port therefore cannot read the entity even if someone wanted it to.
 *  2. `TrashAdapter` has exactly `hide` / `unhide` / `purge`. There is deliberately **no
 *     `describe()`** — an adapter method that can throw on read would eventually be called from the
 *     list path and the list would start 500ing on corrupt rows. The way to make that impossible is
 *     for the method not to exist.
 *
 * The shared contracts those rules govern (`TrashPort`, `TrashAdapter`) now live in
 * `@jini-ai/cms/trash`; this file keeps the host removal/transaction contracts.
 *
 * INTERFACES + TYPES ONLY — no logic lives here.

/**
 * Retention window for locally trashed items, in days.
