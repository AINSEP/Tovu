/**
 * @file Zero-setup publishing auth — the grant document.
 * Design note: `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-19-publish-zero-setup-auth-design.md`.
 *
 * A grant is what the DESTINATION knows: which source installation may publish here, which public
 * keys currently speak for it, what it may touch, and until when. It is secret-free by
 * construction — every field below is either a public key, an identifier, or a policy bound — which
 * is what lets it travel as committed deploy config on any provider without a secret store, a
 * vendor CLI, or a human copying anything.
 *
 * TWO INDEPENDENT CEILINGS, and why neither alone is enough:
 *
 * - {@link PUBLISHING_CAPABILITIES} is a CLOSED allowlist this file owns. A grant that names any
 *   other capability — `content.write`, `admin.*`, `*` — is rejected at parse time, not filtered.
 *   This is the direct answer to Codex's finding that publishing rides the general auth path on
 *   ordinary `content.write`: a stolen publishing credential cannot reach `POST /posts`, because no
 *   grant claiming the capability that route needs can ever parse.
 * - {@link PUBLISH_TRUST_ROUTES} is likewise owned here, NOT by the grant. A grant cannot widen the
 *   route surface even by naming one, because it has no field to name one with. A route added to
 *   this codebase tomorrow is absent from this list, so it is unreachable by a publishing
 *   credential until someone deliberately adds it here — fail-closed against future growth, which
 *   an allowlist that lived in the credential could not be.
 *
 * Rejection is total: {@link parsePublishTrustGrant} returns a reason, never a repaired grant. A
 * parser that "fixed up" a grant would let a malformed or hostile document degrade into a valid one.
