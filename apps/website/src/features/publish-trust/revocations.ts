/**
 * @file Zero-setup publishing auth — disconnecting a computer, without a deploy.
 *
 * `provisioning.ts` carries GRANTS in committed config, which is what makes the feature need no key
 * ceremony. It also means a grant only changes when someone deploys, and that is not good enough for
 * revocation: "this computer must stop publishing here" cannot wait on a pipeline, a provider
 * console, or whoever happens to push next.
 *
 * So there are two stores, with a deliberate asymmetry:
 *
 * - **Committed config can only GRANT.** It ships inside the image, it is reviewable in a diff, and
 *   it is restored by a redeploy.
 * - **This store can only DENY.** Production persists it in the destination's content database,
 *   is written by the running process, and takes effect on the next request.
 *
 * Deny wins, and a redeploy cannot clear a denial because denials are not in the image. That single
 * property is what makes three separate claims true at once: revocation does not need a deploy,
 * revocation does not need provider access, and a ROLLBACK to an older commit cannot resurrect a
 * computer the owner disconnected — which the committed-config path on its own could not promise.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED HERE MEANS THE OPPOSITE OF `provisioning.ts`. An unreadable GRANT document must admit
 * nobody; an unreadable REVOCATION list must also admit nobody. Both stores fail towards "no
 * publishing", which means this one fails towards treating everyone as disconnected — see
 * {@link admitPublish}. Getting that backwards would turn a corrupt file into a bypass.
 *
 * The durable production adapter is deliberately selected by the composition root, over the same
 * `content.db` that holds the site's content. A deployment that loses that database has an obvious
 * content-loss outage; there is no second mount path whose omission can silently reconnect a
 * disconnected computer.
