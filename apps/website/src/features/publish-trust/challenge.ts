/**
 * @file Zero-setup publishing auth — proof of possession.
 * Design note: `ADS-memory/reports/2026-09-19-publish-zero-setup-auth-design.md`.
 *
 * The source never sends a secret. It proves it holds the private half of a public key the
 * destination was already given (as committed deploy config) by signing a nonce the DESTINATION
 * chose. Four bindings are inside the signed bytes, and each one closes a specific attack:
 *
 * - `nonce` — single-use and short-lived, so a captured response cannot be replayed.
 * - `targetInstallationId` (the audience) — so a response captured by, or produced for, one
 *   destination cannot be presented at another. Note this is belt AND braces: `keys.ts` already
 *   derives a different keypair per destination, so a cross-destination replay fails on the
 *   signature too. Two independent mechanisms, because an audience check is the one a future
 *   refactor is most likely to drop.
 * - `sourceInstallationId` + `generation` — pins which installation and which rotation generation
 *   is claiming to speak, so a valid signature from an old generation cannot be re-labelled as a
 *   new one.
 * - `capabilities` — the caller states what it is asking for and signs it, so the request cannot be
 *   escalated in flight. It is then intersected with the grant, which is the real ceiling.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED EVERYWHERE: every rejection below returns a reason string, never a throw and never a
 * partially-verified result. `reason` names the check that failed for the operator's log; it is
 * never returned to the caller, because "expired nonce" vs "unknown nonce" is an oracle.
