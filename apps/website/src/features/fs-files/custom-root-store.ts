/**
 * @file The operator-set custom filesystem root — backs the third {@link FsRootId} `"custom"`
 * (`layout.ts`), holding whatever absolute directory the human operator has pointed the assistant at
 * through the chat composer's folder control (`apps/admin`'s `AssistantDock`), independent of the
 * `repo`/`site` roots.
 *
 * ## Path only, nothing read (2026-09-10 owner decision)
 *
 * "when we upload a folder we don't upload everything in the folder, that's disastrous, we are
 * uploading the filepath" — the owner's own words. {@link setCustomFsRoot} captures the path and
 * nothing else: the single `stat`/`realpath` call below confirms the entry's own existence and kind,
 * the same metadata `ls -d` would show, and touches nothing inside it. No file under the folder is
 * read, copied, indexed, or walked at set time, so a 76 GB folder costs exactly what an empty one
 * does until a later `fs_list_files`/`fs_read_file` call names a specific path — and THAT call
 * re-validates containment and the denylist independently of this module ever having been called
 * correctly, identical to how `repo`/`site` are re-checked (see `fs-files.ts`'s header).
 *
 * ## Persisted per workspace, one small JSON file (2026-09-10, follow-up to the slice above)
 *
 * Originally this held a single module-level scalar, forgotten on every process restart — the
 * dev-mode norm here is `tsx-watch` reloading on nearly every save under `apps/website/src`, so the
 * operator had to retype the path after almost every edit. This module now persists a
 * `{ [workspaceId]: absolutePath }` map to `<site>/.fs-custom-root.json` (`persistenceFilePath`),
 * next to the site's other small standalone config files (`.site-meta.json`, `config.json`) rather
 * than in `content.db` — no schema, no migration, trivially inspectable, and it stays out of the way
 * of whoever owns `platform/db/**` right now. There is deliberately no in-memory cache: every read
 * (`getCustomFsRoot`/`getCustomFsRootStatus`) goes straight to disk and every write
 * (`setCustomFsRoot`) goes straight back, temp-file-then-rename, so "restart survives" is not a
 * separate code path to get right — it is the ONLY code path, and two processes (or `tsx-watch`
 * reloading mid-request) can never observe a value the file itself doesn't hold.
 *
 * Keyed by `workspaceId` (the same string `FsFilesToolDeps.workspaceId`/`RouteDeps.workspaceId`
 * already carry) because the admin-http route is already workspace-addressed
 * (`/workspaces/:workspaceId/fs-files/custom-root`) — a single scalar shared across every workspace
 * this process might ever serve would be the cruder shape, not the safer one.
 *
 * A path an operator set that no longer stats as a directory (folder moved or deleted since) is
 * reported honestly rather than folded back into "nothing was ever set": see
 * {@link getCustomFsRootStatus}'s `vanished`/`vanishedPath` fields. `getCustomFsRoot` — the plain
 * accessor `layout.ts`'s `resolveFsRoots` calls to actually resolve a usable directory — treats a
 * vanished path the same as an unset one (`undefined`), since either way there is no directory left
 * to read from; only the richer status accessor keeps the distinction, for the admin route to surface
 * to a human. Reading a corrupt or unparseable persistence file degrades to "nothing persisted" rather
 * than throwing, so a hand-edited or truncated `.fs-custom-root.json` can never crash a caller that
 * merely wanted to know the current root — though any other read failure (e.g. `EACCES` on the site
 * directory) still propagates.
 *
 * ## No permission model here, by design
 *
 * Every `fs_list_files`/`fs_read_file` call against the `custom` root passes through the exact same
 * `content.read`-gated `authorize()` check and the same denylist as `repo`/`site` (see
 * `tool-registrations.ts`), and the admin-http route that calls {@link setCustomFsRoot}
 * (`routes/fs-files/custom-root.ts`) is gated by that identical permission. Whoever may set this path
 * is already trusted with `content.read`; no separate grant/approval/confirmation ceremony exists for
 * the path itself, and none should be added here — seeding one back in would re-introduce exactly the
 * restrictiveness `layout.ts`'s header records the owner rejecting.
