/**
 * @file The `fs-files` domain's agent-tool catalog: two read-only tools, `fs_list_files` and
 * `fs_read_file`, plus the carded picked-folder batch write `fs_write_files`, instantiating SPEC-016 REQ-22's naming/callability convention (the same shape
 * `theme/agent-tools.ts`, `site-evidence/agent-tools.ts`, and every other domain catalog already
 * use).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Today the assistant has NO filesystem access at all — every existing read-oriented tool
 * (`theme_read_file`, `content_read.*`, `custom_credential_make_request`) reads through a
 * domain-specific store, never a raw path. The concrete bug this closes: an Agent Plugin's own
 * bundled `references/*.template.*` files (shipped alongside its `SKILL.md`/manifest, meant to be
 * read and adapted by the agent installing it) are unreachable, because nothing exposes a plugin's
 * own directory to the model that is supposed to use it.
 *
 * ## Site-agent boundary (2026-10-23 owner decision, supersedes September 10 for these callers)
 *
 * Historical rule (superseded for picked folders by owner s5, 2026-10-29): site-agent execution
 * refused `repo`, outside `custom` roots, and other-site selectors. The persisted owner-picked
 * `custom` folder now grants read access outside the site; repo and other-site selectors remain
 * refused. All reads still use Jini's guarded reader and the secret denylist.
 * The historical rationale below is retained to explain why the broader roots still exist.
 *
 * ## Historical default-allow with a denylist (2026-09-10 owner decision)
 *
 * This domain shipped (commit `68d7e525`) as a five-member named-root allowlist scoped to
 * `<site>/agent-plugins`, `<site>/themes`, `<site>/skills`, `<site>/uploads`, and the bundled
 * `content/agent-plugins` — with everything else structurally unreachable, including the site
 * directory itself (`chat.db`, `content.db`) and the repo. The product owner reversed that: her call
 * is default-allow — the assistant should be able to read most of the repo/site tree without anyone
 * pre-listing a root — with the real boundary moved onto an explicit denylist of what must never be
 * read.
 *
 * `layout.ts`'s roots are now deliberately broad, not curated:
 * - `repo` — this installation's whole repository/product tree, outside the active site.
 * - `site` — THIS site's entire data folder, including `chat.db`/`content.db`/`config.json`/`ops/`,
 *   not merely its `agent-plugins`/`themes`/`skills`/`uploads` subdirectories as before.
 * - `custom` — an operator-set folder anywhere on the machine, unrelated to this repo or site;
 *   `undefined`/refused until an operator sets one from the chat composer (`layout.ts`'s own header).
 *
 * `fs-files.ts`'s `FS_FILES_DENYLIST` is now the PRIMARY gate, not defense in depth underneath an
 * allowlist: any path with a `secrets` segment at any depth, `.env`/`.env.*`, `*.pem`/`*.key`/`*.p12`,
 * and `*.db`/`*.db-wal`/`*.db-shm` are refused wherever they appear, regardless of root. That last
 * pattern is doing real work it did not used to have to do: `chat.db`/`content.db` are no longer kept
 * out by LOCATION (the site directory was never a root before), only by this pattern plus the binary
 * sniff — read `fs-files.ts`'s own header for the full argument and what that trade costs.
 * `node_modules`/`.git`/build output are excluded from `fs_list_files` listings for ergonomics only
 * (`fs-files.ts`'s `EXCLUDED_LISTING_DIR_NAMES`) — not part of the security boundary, and a direct
 * `fs_read_file` call into one of them is not refused.
 *
 * ## Why read-only, and why no write/edit/delete/rename tool exists in this domain
 *
 * Unlike `theme_write_file` (whose safety argument is "every theme file is re-validated by
 * `loadTheme` on every write, regardless of who wrote it" — see `theme/agent-tools.ts`'s own
 * header), NOTHING downstream of a write through an arbitrary path under either root re-validates
 * anything: a `<site>/agent-plugins/<id>/mcp.json` edited in place is not re-checked against the
 * Agent Plugins manifest schema the way a theme template is re-checked against the Liquid/Handlebars
 * allowlists. Granting write access here would be granting unvalidated, unaudited mutation of
 * installed-plugin manifests, theme source (already covered, more safely, by `theme_write_file`),
 * the site's uploaded media, and now the whole repository — with no load-bearing check to catch a
 * mistake. This slice is therefore READ-ONLY by design, not by omission: `fs_list_files`/
 * `fs_read_file` are the entire catalog, and a future write/edit/delete/rename tool in this domain is
 * a new, separately-reviewed decision, not a natural extension of this one.
 *
 * That decision (owner 2026-10-27): `fs_write_files` writes ONLY into the owner-picked folder outside
 * the site, as one batch the human approves on one card that lists every file — the human reviewing
 * the exact bytes is the validator the paragraph above says is otherwise missing. No other root is
 * writable through this domain.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * The server-side tool filter (ADR-014) consumes this catalog to decide which tool names an agent
 * session may even see; `authorize()` (ADR-021 §2) enforces the actual permission checks at call
 * time — this module only declares the catalog shape, it performs no I/O and no enforcement itself.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `fs-files` feature domain. Imports only its own domain's constants (`fs-files.ts`'s byte ceiling,
 * `layout.ts`'s root ids), so the published JSON Schemas cannot drift from the validators — same
 * discipline `theme/agent-tools.ts`/`redirects/agent-tools.ts` already use.
