/**
 * @file Boot-time backfill of a permission onto a BUILT-IN role's policy, for workspaces that were
 * already seeded before that permission existed.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * There are two ways a permission reaches a policy in this system, and between them they miss a
 * case that every deployed install is in:
 *
 * - `seedIdentity`'s built-in grant lists (`@jini-ai/cms`) reach a workspace exactly once, on first
 *   boot. It early-returns the moment an owner user exists, so a string added to those lists later
 *   provably never reaches an already-seeded workspace.
 * - `migrateDeprecatedPermissionGrants` (`permission-migrations.ts`) fans a new string out to every
 *   policy that already holds some OTHER string. That works only when such an anchor exists in the
 *   target workspace — it is a rename/split mechanism, and a `from` row that is absent matches
 *   nothing and grants nothing, silently.
 *
 * A permission introduced after a workspace was seeded, whose intended holder happens not to hold a
 * suitable anchor string in THAT workspace, therefore reaches nobody. It is not a fail-open — the
 * gate still evaluates and still refuses — but it is a silent capability REMOVAL: the feature stops
 * working for its intended role, and the only principal left is `owner`, on its `*` wildcard.
 *
 * This module is the third path: state the grant against the built-in ROLE it belongs to, and let
 * boot reconcile it. That is the same thing the seed list says, expressed so it also applies to a
 * workspace the seed will never visit again.
 *
 * ## Why by role, and why that is safe
 *
 * A registration names a built-in role (`"admin"`), not a policy id and not a policy name. The
 * fan-out resolves that to the role's OWN built-in policy — `seedIdentity` creates each built-in
 * role 1:1 with a `${name}-builtin-policy` marked `isBuiltin` — and writes one row there.
 *
 * The safety property is structural rather than incidental: the write targets one specific policy
 * row, so a policy belonging to a DIFFERENT role cannot be reached. Granting to `admin` cannot
 * touch `editor-builtin-policy` for the same reason it cannot touch an unrelated workspace's rows —
 * not because of an ordering, a guard, or a filter that a later edit could weaken.
 *
 * Non-built-in policies bound to the role are skipped. Those are operator-created attachments whose
 * contents are an operator's decision, not the library's; the built-in seed lists are the only
 * thing this mechanism is reconciling.
 *
 * ## Additive-only, like its neighbour
 *
 * Same invariant as `migrateDeprecatedPermissionGrants` and for the same reason: there is no
 * delete, no update, and no rewrite of any existing row anywhere in this file. A partial or failed
 * run leaves the previous, still-functioning state. Re-running is a no-op once the row exists, so
 * it is safe on every boot. Reverting a grant means deleting its registration — after which this
 * module stops ADDING the row, and removing the already-granted row is a deliberate, separate
 * operator action rather than something a code revert performs silently.
