/**
 * @file The `admin.security.site-key.manage` permission, and the grants that make it real —
 * gates the admin Security page's "Site key" tab (view/generate the
 * `TOVU_SITE_KEY` site key, `features/webhooks/keyring.env.ts`'s
 * `inspectSiteKeyMaterial`/`generateFileSiteKey`).
 *
 * ## Why its own permission, not an identity check
 *
 * The owner explicitly rejected gating this on "is the workspace creator" — identity checks do
 * not compose with roles (a second admin the owner adds could never manage the site key, and
 * there is no way to delegate it short of sharing the owner's own login). A permission composes
 * the normal way: any role — built-in or custom — can be granted it.
 *
 * ## Why its own string, not reusing `admin.integrations.manage`
 *
 * `admin.integrations.manage` gates a saved CONNECTION's config (OAuth connector settings,
 * webhooks). The site key is a different order of sensitivity — it is the one thing that
 * DECRYPTS every sealed credential this install holds, including everything
 * `admin.integrations.manage` already protects. Collapsing the two would mean any future,
 * narrower grant of connector-config access silently also grants site-key control, which is not
 * a decision this file gets to make on that permission's behalf.
 *
 * ## The two grants below, same shape as `features/pages/permissions.ts`'s
 * `pages.edit_html` (see that file's own header for the full reasoning this mirrors)
 *
 * - the migration `{ from: "admin.integrations.manage", to: [...] }` reaches any
 *   workspace whose `admin` policy already holds `admin.integrations.manage` — every FRESHLY
 *   seeded workspace, since `@jini-ai/cms`'s `BUILTIN_ADMIN_PERMISSIONS` includes it.
 * - the built-in-role grant `{ role: "admin", ... }` states the same intent directly against
 *   the role, so a workspace seeded before `admin.integrations.manage` existed (this repo's own
 *   installs may be exactly that, per `pages/permissions.ts`'s own account of `sites/tovu-com/
 *   content.db`) still reaches `admin` even though the migration's `from` row is absent there.
 *
 * `owner` needs neither: `authorize()` short-circuits on its `*` wildcard before ever looking for
 * a matching `policy_permissions` row. `editor`/`viewer` get neither grant, deliberately — this
 * is a narrower trust boundary than ordinary content admin.
 *
 * ## Ordering
 *
 * The registrations below must run before `migrateDeprecatedPermissionGrants`/
 * `applyBuiltinRoleGrants` do. They used to be module-evaluation side effects that ran first only
 * because {@link SITE_KEY_MANAGE_PERMISSION} is imported by `server/inbound/admin-http/routes/
 * system/site-key.ts`, which sat in `composition/app.ts`'s static import graph — the same "reached
 * via its own consumer" mechanism `pages/permissions.ts` relied on. They are now an explicit call:
 * `server/runtime/composition/app-permission-grants.ts` invokes
 * {@link registerSiteKeyPermissionGrants} on the registry every composition root passes to
 * identity wiring.
