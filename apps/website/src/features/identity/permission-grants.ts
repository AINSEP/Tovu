/**
 * @file The one object that says which permission grants boot reconciles.
 *
 * Both boot-time grant paths read it: `migrateDeprecatedPermissionGrants` (`migrations`, the
 * `from`-anchored fan-out) and `applyBuiltinRoleGrants` (`roleGrants`, stated against a built-in
 * role). A composition root creates one, lets each feature that owns a permission register its own
 * grants on it explicitly (`server/runtime/composition/app-permission-grants.ts` is that list), and
 * passes it to identity wiring as a port.
 *
 * Both registries used to be module singletons filled by import side effects, so the grants a
 * process reconciled depended on which modules it happened to import: every real composition root
 * reached `features/pages/permissions.ts` only through an unrelated barrel import, and
 * `development/scripts/backfill-reset-admin-password.ts` did not reach it at all and reconciled
 * against an empty registry (`11aa47080`).
