/**
 * @file The optimistic-concurrency boundary for `updatePost` (2026-09-06) — shared by every arm
 * that lets an outside caller send a version basis.
 *
 * `be45461e` put the guard in `updatePost` itself; `9c7d16bf` wired the admin HTTP route, and this
 * module exists because a SECOND arm (`features/post/tool-registrations.ts`'s `content_post_update`,
 * the assistant's route into the same domain function) then needed the identical validation and the
 * identical conflict vocabulary. Both arms import from here rather than keeping a copy: a second
 * inline copy is exactly how one arm gets fixed and its sibling silently keeps the bug, which is
 * the defect this whole change is closing in the first place.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT inside `post.ts`: `updatePost` receives an already-typed `number | undefined`
 * and has no business knowing what an untrusted wire value looks like. This is the boundary that
 * turns `unknown` into that, and the boundary is what both callers share.

 * Throws rather than returning `undefined` for anything else, and that is the whole point of this
 * function existing: `expectedVersion` is OPTIONAL in `UpdatePostInput`, so a value a caller failed
 * to recognize would coerce to "no basis sent" and be written through as an unguarded,
 * last-write-wins save — silently re-opening the exact clobber the guard exists to close. A caller
 * that sends `"3"`, `3.5`, `-1`, `null` or `true` has a bug; it must hear about it, not have its
 * edit land on top of somebody else's.
 *
 * `PostValidationError` (not a bespoke type) so it reaches each arm's EXISTING malformed-input
 * branch — a 400 on the HTTP route, a `ToolInputError`-decorated shape rejection on the agent tool
 * — and so it stays the same error class every other malformed field already throws. Deliberately
 * NOT a `PostConflictError`: resending the identical request cannot fix a stale basis, but it CAN
 * fix a mistyped one.
