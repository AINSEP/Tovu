/**
 * @file The durable FTS5 + BM25 adapter behind `PostSearchPort` — Tovu's posts equivalent of
 * `@jini-ai/sqlite`'s `tool_catalog` helpers, and deliberately NOT a reuse of them.
 *
 * Why not reuse. `ensureToolCatalogTables`/`reseedToolCatalog`/`searchToolCatalog` are a genuinely
 * good fit for what they index and a genuinely bad one for this. Their table is keyed by tool id
 * with a `description` and a `source`; their sync model is `DELETE FROM` + reinsert every row +
 * `'rebuild'` the whole index, on the sound argument (their own module doc's) that the source of
 * truth is a `ToolRegistry` reassembled from static code on every boot, so a wholesale snapshot can
 * only ever lag, never diverge. Posts have no such moment. They are mutable user data edited one row
 * at a time by humans and agents all day, so a wholesale rebuild would be both the wrong cost model
 * (O(corpus) per edit) and the wrong correctness model (nothing to trigger it). Contorting those
 * three functions into per-row maintenance would leave a shared API whose two callers want opposite
 * things. What IS reused is the approach: external-content FTS5, `bm25()` with per-column weights
 * passed at query time, alphanumeric-only tokenization of the user's query, and the score inversion
 * so higher means better.
 *
 * Sync model, and what makes it hard to get wrong:
 *  - The searchable TEXT of a post (`title`/`slug`/plain text of `body_json`) changes in exactly one
 *    place — `SqlPostRepo.save()`, the sole writer of those columns (verified across the repo:
 *    the only other statement that touches `posts` is `seedContentDb`'s first-run demo insert, which
 *    `backfillPostSearchIndex` covers). `save()` calls the projection's `upsert` in the same
 *    transaction, so the projection cannot be left stale by a normal write.
 *  - Everything ELSE a search must respect — workspace, `kind`, `status`, and the soft-delete
 *    marker — is NOT indexed and is filtered from the live `posts` row at query time. That is the
 *    load-bearing decision in this file: publishing, unpublishing, trashing, and restoring a post
 *    all change what search may return WITHOUT changing a single indexed character, so making them
 *    query-time filters means those four operations need no index write at all and therefore cannot
 *    forget one. `deletePost` -> `softDelete()` writes only `deleted_at`/`updated_at`/`version`, and
 *    `postDeleteReverter` restores through `save()`; neither needs to know this index exists.
 *  - `post_search_document` -> `post_search_fts` is kept in sync by the three triggers the 0022
 *    migration installs, so a writer of the projection table cannot forget the index either.
 *
 * Dialect-specific SQL lives here ON PURPOSE (storage-adapter plan F1): `MATCH`, `bm25()`,
 * `snippet()` and a virtual table joined on its own `rowid` exist only in SQLite, so the query is a
 * `sql` template run through `kernel.run` — the kernel, never the raw better-sqlite3 handle. The
 * Postgres twin is `search-index.postgres.ts`; `search-index.ts` picks between them.

/**
 * BM25 column weights, in `post_search_fts`'s declared column order (title, slug, body_text).
 *
 * Weighted, not uniform, because the product question is "where's the page ABOUT x" — a title match
 * is a claim that the document is about the term, while one body occurrence is a claim that the term
 * was mentioned. The slug sits between them: it is usually title-derived, it is human-chosen, and it
 * is literally the thing a navigation answer has to produce. The absolute numbers are a ratio, not a
 * calibration — BM25 already normalizes for field length, so these only need to encode
 * title > slug >> body, which they do at 8:4:1. Passed at query time (SQLite allows it), so retuning
 * them is a one-line change with no reindex, exactly as `searchToolCatalog` does with its own 6:1.
