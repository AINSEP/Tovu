/**
 * @file Resolves the media reference a caller gives for a post/page's featured image (2026-10-05)
 * to the canonical asset id `PostRecord.featuredMediaId` stores.
 *
 * Why the id and never the slug: the render path looks the featured asset up by id
 * (`featuredImageView` in `render.ts` reads `mediaAssetMetadata.get(post.featuredMediaId)`), and a
 * media slug is editable, so storing one would break the moment the asset is renamed.
 *
 * `normalizeFeaturedMediaId` (`post.ts`) checks shape only; this is the existence check it defers
 * to "the caller that resolved it". Both writers call it: the agent tool (`resolveFeaturedImageInput`
 * in `tool-registrations.ts`) and the admin REST post/page update routes (via
 * {@link resolveFeaturedMediaIdForWrite}). The REST arm was added 2026-10-05 after a visual check
 * saved a VIDEO as a post's featured image through the editor's picker — the picker trusting the
 * library was not enough, because the library holds videos too.
