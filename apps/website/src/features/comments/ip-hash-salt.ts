/**
 * @file The salt `POST /api/site/comments` folds into `authorIpHash` (2026-10-08 hardwiring audit
 * #4). Resolved ONCE by the composition root and injected into the route, which never reads env.
 *
 * Why not the old public constant: the route used to fall back to `"dev-only-insecure-salt"`
 * whenever `COMMENTS_IP_SALT` was unset, and nothing (boot gate, deploy config) ever asked for that
 * var. Every such install salted with the same string printed in this repo, so anyone holding a
 * copied `content.db` could reverse every commenter's IP hash with a single IPv4-space dictionary.
 *
 * Why derive from the site key instead of minting and persisting a new random salt: the site key
 * IS this install's existing, durable, per-install secret store — production refuses to boot
 * without it (`boot-readiness-gate.ts`, missing-site-key) and it already lives outside the portable
 * `content.db`. An HKDF derivation under its own `purpose` is one-way and domain-separated from
 * every other use of that key (`KeyringPort.derive()`'s contract), needs no new file, no new
 * migration, and is stable across restarts and redeploys. A copied `content.db` alone stays
 * unreversible. The only coupling: rotating the site key changes the salt, so hashes recorded
 * before the rotation stop matching new ones — set `COMMENTS_IP_SALT` to decouple them.
 *
 * Order: an explicit `COMMENTS_IP_SALT` wins; else the site-key derivation; else (no usable site
 * key) a local/dev server keeps the old dev constant, while a production server gets a random
 * per-process salt and a warning — never a public constant. That last branch is unreachable
 * through the real boot paths (the production gate refuses first) and exists as a fail-safe.
