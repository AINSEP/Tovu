/**
 * @file ADR-031 §4 — `CommentIngressPolicy`, the single core-mediated public-submission
 * boundary (mirrors ADR-027's one `MediaIngressPolicy`). Enforces, in order:
 * comments-enabled → entry-open → parent-exists → depth-cap → rate-limit → honeypot/size/link
 * caps → sanitize → hook chain (veto/transform) → spam classification → write.
 *
 * Spam is stored silently (`status: "spam"`), never rejected at the boundary — a rejection is an
 * oracle a spammer tunes against (ADR-031 §4's own explicit instruction).
 *
 * `entryLookup` is a narrow, caller-injected dependency (ADR-046 Phase 3's "narrow typed
 * dependencies" convention) rather than a direct import of the entries feature module — its
 * `commentsClosed` field is where `CommentsSettings.closeAfterDays` math against the entry's own
 * publish date belongs; this file does not duplicate that logic.
 *
 * `authorIpHash`/honeypot are read from `submission.ingressContext` (already computed/salted by
 * the HTTP route layer, per `CommentSubmission`'s own doc: "the raw IP is never stored" — this
 * file never sees it) under the fixed keys `authorIpHash` and `honeypotValue`.
 *
 * `getSettings` (SPEC-035, ADR-028 Settings Layered Ledger wiring) is a per-call RESOLVER, not a
 * boot-captured snapshot — `submit()` reads it fresh at the top of every call, so an operator's
 * settings change via the admin `PUT .../comments/settings` route (`settings.ts`) takes effect on
 * the very next submission, not only after a restart. `index.ts` builds this resolver from
 * `settingsRepo` when the composition root supplies one, falling back to a fixed snapshot
 * otherwise (hermetic tests that don't wire the ledger).

 * at depth 0 with no thread root yet (the comment being created becomes its own root — see
 * `submit()`'s own `threadRootId: parentThreadRootId ?? id`).
 *
 * BUG FIX (this pass — found auditing this exact function for the complexity refactor, not
 * introduced by it): the parent lookup never checked that the found parent actually belongs to
 * the SAME entry as this submission — `CommentRepoPort.findById` is keyed only on
 * `(workspaceId, id)`, not `entryId`. A submission could supply an `entryId` for one (open,
 * comments-enabled) entry and a `parentId` that is really a comment on a completely different
 * entry, silently grafting the new comment onto that other entry's thread (wrong `threadRootId`,
 * a `depth` computed against an unrelated thread). `types.ts`'s own header says this referential
 * integrity is "validated at the write chokepoint, NOT by a DB foreign key" (i.e. here) — this was
 * the gap. Treated as `parent-not-found`, not a new rejection reason: from the submitter's point
 * of view, the parent they asked for does not exist ON THIS ENTRY. Regression:
 * `ingress.test.ts` ("a parentId belonging to a different entry...").
