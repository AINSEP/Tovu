/**
 * @file Every network request the screenshot browser makes, decided and carried here — Chromium
 * itself never opens a socket.
 *
 * The browser context routes `**\/*` to {@link createRequestRouter}. Each request is either aborted
 * or FETCHED BY THIS PROCESS and fulfilled back into the page:
 *
 * - **Public origins** go through the injected guarded client — the same `@jini-ai/platform` guard
 *   `web_fetch_page` and `media_import_from_url` use. It resolves DNS, refuses loopback, RFC1918,
 *   link-local/cloud-metadata and IPv6 ULA/mapped addresses, and PINS the vetted address for the
 *   connection, so a DNS-rebinding answer between "check" and "connect" cannot reach a private host.
 *   That pinning is why requests are fetched here rather than vetted and then `continue()`d: a
 *   continued request is resolved again by Chromium, after the check.
 * - **A redirect is never handed to Chromium.** The guard itself does not follow one
 *   (`maxRedirects: 0`), and a 3xx is not fulfilled either: Playwright does NOT route the next hop of
 *   a fulfilled redirect — Chromium sends it straight to the network (verified against real Chromium,
 *   2026-10-08), where only the launch's dead proxy stops it. So the router follows every redirect
 *   itself, one hop at a time, and each hop is decided and fetched exactly like a new request: a
 *   redirect to a private address is refused at the hop that introduces it. A subresource's hops are
 *   followed here and the final answer fulfilled; the page's own (main-frame) navigation is aborted
 *   with its target recorded ({@link RequestRouter.takeNavigationRedirect}), and the capture navigates
 *   to that target, so the document lives at its real URL and relative links resolve against it.
 * - **The allowlisted origins** (only ever this site's own per-call loopback render, injected by the
 *   host for own-site screenshots) go through `ownSiteFetch`, a plain loopback fetch that is never
 *   handed any other origin.
 * - Everything else is aborted: non-http(s) schemes, any method but GET/HEAD (a screenshot needs no
 *   writes, beacons or form posts), streaming/media types that only cost bandwidth in a still
 *   picture, and anything past the per-capture request/byte budget.
 *
 * Cookies and credentials never travel: request `Cookie`/`Authorization` headers are dropped and
 * response `Set-Cookie` is stripped, on top of the fresh, storage-less context per capture.
