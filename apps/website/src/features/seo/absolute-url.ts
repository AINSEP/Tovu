/**
 * @file `toAbsoluteUrl`/`resolveWorkspaceOrigin` — the one seam that joins a workspace's verified
 * origin onto a site-relative path (SPEC-008 gap fix, 2026-09-03).
 *
 * Before this file existed, `canonical`, `og:url`, `og:image`, and `twitter:image` all emitted bare
 * paths (`/documentation`, `/m/{assetId}/...`) on both production and local — reproduced with
 * `curl` against both. A relative `rel="canonical"` is technically resolvable by a search engine
 * (it resolves against the page's own URL), but `og:url`/`og:image` MUST be absolute per the Open
 * Graph protocol: every social crawler and link-preview fetcher fails to resolve a relative one, so
 * link previews for the live site were silently broken.
 *
 * Root cause: `platform/routing/routing.ts`'s `composeCanonicalUrl` has carried a `TODO(ADR-040)`
 * since routing was built — "compose canonicalUrl from OriginRegistryPort.canonicalOrigin(ctx) once
 * src/origin exists" — but nothing ever wired it up once `src/origin` (now `features/origin`)
 * landed; `RouteResolveContext.originOverride` (the seam that TODO describes) is never populated by
 * any real caller. This file is that wiring, scoped to SEO's own two call sites
 * (`seo.ts`'s `resolveCanonical`/`resolveShareImages`, and `routes/site/pages.ts`'s
 * `buildExtraHead` for the entry-less home/page canonical) rather than a change to the shared
 * `routing` library itself — `urlFor`/`entryPublicPath`/`RouteResolverDeps` have call sites well
 * outside SEO's ownership (menus, redirects, post tool-registrations), so widening their signature
 * to do an async origin lookup on every call is a separate, larger change than this bug fix.
 *
 * ONE join point, not scattered string concatenation: every caller in this feature that needs an
 * absolute URL goes through {@link toAbsoluteUrl}.

/**
 * Resolves the workspace's verified origin for {@link toAbsoluteUrl}, degrading to `undefined`
 * when none is registered yet (`OriginNotVerifiedError` — ADR-040's documented fail-closed
 * precondition on `canonicalOrigin`, not a bug). Any OTHER error is a real registry failure and is
 * rethrown rather than silently swallowed into the same degraded path.
 *
 * 2026-09-18 production sitemap fix: a `dev-capability`-sourced origin (always `http://localhost`,
 * per `origin/types.ts`'s own invariant) is ALSO degraded to `undefined` whenever this process is
 * running in production (`resolveRuntimeMode() === "production"`, which `fly.toml` sets). Root
 * cause this guards against: `server/runtime/composition/deps.ts`'s `seedDevCapabilityOrigin` call
 * is the origin registry's only writer (`origin-repo.sqlite.ts`'s file header — "no admin route or
 * verification flow exists yet to let an operator register a real production origin") and runs
 * unconditionally on every boot, including the Fly deployment's. Its first boot durably persisted
 * `http://localhost:3000` into `content.db`'s `origin_settings` table, and its own idempotent
 * find-or-create contract (by design, so a future real registration is never clobbered) means that
 * row survives every later boot too — it can never self-correct on its own. Every public SEO
 * document (`sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`'s `Sitemap:` line, `canonical`, `og:url`, `og:image`) goes
 * through this one seam, so this is the one place that must refuse to let that row leak into a
 * document served to real crawlers. Degrading here reuses the SAME pre-existing "no verified
 * origin" relative-path fallback `toAbsoluteUrl` already had — never a fabricated origin, per
 * INV-07. Outside production (local dev, tests), a `dev-capability` origin still resolves as
 * before — its entire purpose is to let a dev server exercise absolute-URL code paths.
 *
 * @param mode - Defaults to `resolveRuntimeMode`; injectable for tests, mirroring
 * `root-key-boot-notice.ts`'s `RootKeyBootNoticeDeps.mode` convention.
 * @complexity O(1) plus one `canonicalOrigin` lookup.
