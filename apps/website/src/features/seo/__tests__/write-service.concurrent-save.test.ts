/**
 * @file SEO-01 (fable bugs audit, 2026-09-06) — `setEntrySeoOverrides` is the third compare-less
 * version bump on the `posts.version` column, and the only one whose caller never states a basis at
 * all.
 *
 * The shape: `findById` (await) -> merge the patch -> `postRepo.save({ ...existing, seoExtJson,
 * version: existing.version + 1 })`. `save()` is an unconditional whole-row upsert, so everything
 * the row gained between the read and the write — a content save's `bodyJson`, `title`, `status` —
 * is overwritten with the values `existing` was holding. An SEO-only edit silently reverts somebody
 * else's content edit, and reports success.
 *
 * The interleave below is deterministic, not timing-dependent: a repo decorator lands a competing
 * content save inside the gap, on the first read, exactly where a real concurrent write would land.
 *
 * "What would this still pass under?" — a fix that merely re-reads the row immediately before the
 * save would satisfy the content assertions here (the decorator fires once), and would still be the
 * same TOCTOU one await later. That is why the mechanism is asserted too: this write path must go
 * through the version-predicated `saveIfVersion`, never the unconditional `save()`.
