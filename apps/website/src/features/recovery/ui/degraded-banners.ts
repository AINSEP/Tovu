/**
 * @file SPEC-019 C-308 / behavior.spec.md §1.1 — degraded-state banner precedence resolver
 * (ADR-045 §4).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Fixed precedence, highest to lowest: `migration.interrupted` > `PENDING_MIGRATION` >
 * operation-in-flight > `costClass:'unavailable'` > watermark-baseline-unavailable. Only the
 * PRIMARY banner selection is this resolver's contract (EC-06) — "an interrupted-run banner stays
 * visible beneath a superseded pending-migration banner" is a rendering-layer composition concern
 * this function does not own.
 *
 * `PENDING_MIGRATION`'s action always deep-links to the Database Timeline's own migration ceremony, never a
 * Recovery restore-flow action (AC-27/INV-07, ADR-045 §4) — restoring to an older snapshot does
 * not resolve schema drift against the current runtime.
