/**
 * @file The Change Sets domain's agent-tool catalog (F7b option A, S6, 2026-09-24) —
 * `change_sets_list` + `change_sets_revert`, the agent-callable half of the admin Recovery page's
 * own change-set list/revert routes (`server/inbound/admin-http/routes/change-sets/list.ts`,
 * `.../revert.ts`).
 *
 * Scope, stated plainly because it is also this pass's own limit, not an oversight: a change set
 * exists today only for a post/page create/update/delete (`features/post/reverters.ts` registers
 * exactly `post/update` and `post/delete` into the shared `RevertRegistry`; nothing else in this
 * codebase writes a change-set row yet). So "undo" through these two tools covers post and page
 * edits and deletes — nothing wider. Both tool descriptions say this outright, so an agent does not
 * infer a general-purpose undo that does not exist. Deleted items have their OWN, more direct undo
 * (`trash_restore_item`, `features/trash/tool-registrations.ts`) — a change-set revert of a delete
 * would work too (the post reverter restores the row), but trash is the narrower, purpose-built
 * tool for "bring this back", so both descriptions point there instead of leaving an agent to
 * guess which one to reach for.
 *
 * `change_sets_revert` never accepts `force` — see `contracts/core/commands/revert.ts`'s own
 * `RevertChangeSetRequired.input.force` doc: an operator can explicitly click through a stale-
 * version conflict, but an agent principal is unconditionally forbidden from doing so
 * (`RevertForbiddenError`, `"AGENT_CANNOT_FORCE"`) the same way `gated-mutations/gateway.ts`'s
 * `confirm()` forbids an agent from forcing a plan through. Omitting the parameter from this
 * catalog's schema entirely (rather than accepting it and always sending `false`) makes that
 * refusal a shape fact a model can see up front, not a runtime surprise on the one call where it
 * tries `force: true`.
 *
 * Reversible in the ordinary case (a successful revert can itself be reverted — the revert is a new
 * change set's-worth of writes through the same forward save path each reverter uses), so per the
 * owner's standing rule it gets no confirm dialog — same posture `theme_set_active` and every other
 * reversible write in this codebase already has.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * The server-side tool filter (ADR-014) consumes this catalog to decide which tool names an agent
 * session may even see; `authorize()` (ADR-021 §2) enforces the actual permission checks at call
 * time — this module only declares the catalog shape, it performs no I/O and no enforcement itself.
