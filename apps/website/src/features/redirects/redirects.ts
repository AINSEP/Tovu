/**
 * @file THE `redirects` write chokepoint (SPEC-009 REQ-01/04/05/06/07/08/13/
 * 14/22/26; ADR-PIPE-009 C-001..C-004).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `createRedirect`/`updateRedirect`/`tombstoneRedirect`/`importRedirects` —
 * the single manual-write entry point for redirect rules. Validates the
 * pattern (via `RedirectMatcher.validatePattern`), rejects unsafe targets —
 * absolute ones against the origin allowlist and site-relative ones against
 * the admin application's own URL space (write-path open-redirect oracle,
 * REQ-08; see `assertTargetAllowed`) — collapses/rejects
 * one-hop chains (INV-04), enforces the exact-match dedup rule
 * (behavior.spec.md §5.1), and writes the record + its revision in one
 * transaction via `ports.internal.ts`'s shared `insertRedirectAndRevision`
 * (INV-01/INV-07 — no other file writes `redirects`/`redirect_revisions`).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Feature logic. No Express/route code — route handlers (Phase 2) call these
 * functions directly and map thrown typed errors to HTTP codes per
 * errors.spec.md.

 * allowlist has nothing to say about it — and that used to mean it was not checked at all, which
 * left the admin application's own URL space (`/admin`, `/api/...`, served by this same Express
 * app) usable as a redirect destination from a public-site rule, including through the
 * agent-callable `redirects_create`. `checkSiteRelativeTarget` is the second half; it is the same
 * rule `site-inspection`'s `published_page_fetch` applies to a caller-supplied site path, shared
 * from `platform/routing/reserved-paths.ts` rather than restated here.
 *
 * Note for a workspace that predates this gate: a stored rule whose target is now refused can
 * still be turned off with `tombstoneRedirect` (which only flips `status` and never re-validates
 * the target) or with an `updateRedirect` that changes nothing but `status -> disabled` (see
 * `isDisableOnlyUpdate`), or repointed with `updateRedirect` by supplying a new `toTarget`.
 *
 * An absolute target that names the workspace's OWN origin passes the host oracle trivially (its
 * own host is always allowed there), so it also gets the reserved-path rule — via the same
 * `checkSameOriginDestination` the read path applies to the interpolated `Location` (t91 B1,
 * 2026-09-16). Before this, `/admin`/`/api/...` written as an absolute same-origin target was
 * stored and simply never served, because only the read gate refused it.

 * S7 (web-high fix plan 2026-09-24): a rule with a Trash index row (`deps.isInTrash`, distinct from
 * `status === "disabled"` — see {@link RedirectsWriteDeps.isInTrash}'s own doc) refuses every update
 * EXCEPT a pure `status: "active"` PATCH ({@link isRestoreOnlyUpdate}), which restores it instead of
 * editing a row the caller cannot see the current shape of.
 *
 * @throws {EntityNotLiveError} On a non-restore update to a rule in the Trash.
 * @throws {RedirectConflictError} If the Trash row's version moved before the restore landed.
