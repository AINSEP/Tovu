/**
 * @file The one redirect `Location` value the HTTP layer does not send as written (t91 review F1,
 * 2026-09-16).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Express 4's `res.location()` — called by the `res.redirect(statusCode, location)` that
 * `server/inbound/public-http/routes/site/pages.ts` serves every matched rule with — replaces the
 * exact string `back` with the request's `Referer` header (or `/`). A rule whose finished location
 * is `back` therefore sends the visitor to whatever page linked to this site: an open redirect the
 * origin oracle never sees, because the oracle is asked about `<canonical origin>/back`. The value
 * can be stored literally or produced by interpolation (a wildcard `/go/*` -> `$1` plus a request
 * for `/go/back`), so the WRITE gate (`redirects.ts`) refuses the stored form and the READ gate
 * (`phase-handler.ts`) refuses the finished form.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Feature logic, pure, no I/O.
