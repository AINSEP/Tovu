/**
 * The identity every Redirects registration claims in `routing`'s phase registry
 * (`RegisterResolvePhaseOptions.owner`). One module-private token, shared by every
 * call: there is exactly ONE live Redirects registration per process — whichever
 * composition root registered most recently.
 *
 * That is the policy half of the lifecycle fix `registerResolvePhase`'s own doc
 * describes. `registerRedirectsPhaseHandlers` runs once per composition root, and a
 * process can run more than one of those — an integration test composes one per
 * site it boots. Loading `composition/app.ts` itself registers nothing (removed
 * 2026-09-16, t91 F4.1; `app-module-load-registers-no-phase-handler.test.ts` pins
 * it), so the only way a process gets a second composition is an explicit
 * `createRouteDeps()`/`createSiteRouteDeps()` call. Each registration closes over
 * that composition's own `RedirectRepoPort`, so under the old append-only registry
 * the superseded ones stayed on the live request path: harmless while the orphan was
 * an `InMemoryRedirectRepo` (empty, so it returned `null` and yielded to the real
 * registration queued behind it), a 500 on every phase-running route once it was a
 * `SqliteRedirectRepo` whose site database had since closed. Owning the slot makes
 * W-004's "call exactly once" structural rather than a comment asking nicely.
