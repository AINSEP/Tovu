/**
 * @file `RedirectSlugChangeCapture` — the `SlugChangeCapture` implementation
 * (SPEC-009 REQ-15/16/17; ADR-PIPE-009 Decision A).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The single implementer of `routing`'s `SlugChangeCapture` slot. Inserts an
 * `active`, `source: 'auto_slug_change'`, `matchType: 'exact'` redirect rule +
 * its revision when an entry's routable slug/path changes, so no request can
 * observe the moved entry without its redirect already existing (INV-02).
 *
 * Correctness discipline (Decision A, load-bearing): this class performs NO
 * transaction control of its own — no `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` anywhere in
 * this file. It relies entirely on the caller (the content write chokepoint,
 * once wired — see tasks.md's "Known Scope Boundary": that wiring is OUT OF
 * SCOPE for this feature) already holding an open transaction on the same
 * single-connection `better-sqlite3` handle. Writes go through
 * `ports.internal.ts`'s `insertRedirectAndRevision`, the one shared,
 * non-tx-opening insert path this file and `redirects.ts` both use.
 *
 * Idempotency (REQ-17/AC-20): keyed off the routing-owned
 * `SlugChangeCaptureInput`'s `oldPath`/`newPath` rather than a `changeSetId`
 * DB column — `state.spec.md`'s frozen `RedirectRecord`/`RedirectRevision`
 * shapes (mirrored from the already-written `src/redirects/types.ts`) carry
 * no `changeSetId` field, so this reuses the existing
 * `RedirectRepoPort.lookupExact` read (already on the frozen `ports.ts`)
 * to detect "this exact slug-change was already captured": when the rule that
 * requests for `oldPath` actually follow (`RedirectRepoPort.lookupExact`, the
 * resolver's own newest-wins order) is an `active`, `source: 'auto_slug_change'`
 * rule with `toTarget === newPath`, the same change was already captured, so a
 * retry is a no-op rather than a duplicate insert. It must be the WINNING rule,
 * not just any historical match: after `a→b→a→c→a`, an older `/a → /b` still
 * exists but the newer `/a → /c` wins, so renaming `a→b` again has to insert a
 * fresh `/a → /b` or `/a` keeps resolving to `/c`, whose own rule points back
 * at `/a` — a permanent loop.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Feature logic. No Express/route code, no direct SQL — writes go through the
 * injected `RedirectDbHandle`; reads go through the injected `RedirectRepoPort`.
