/**
 * @file The Pages domain's agent-tool catalog — how the assistant authors a bespoke HTML Page.
 *
 * **Why this is not part of the `post` domain's catalog.** `content_post_*` reads and writes
 * `bodyJson`, a Tiptap document. A Page's real content is `body_html`, which `content_post_update`
 * cannot write and now explicitly ignores. Handing the model one tool family whose behavior silently
 * changes depending on the row's format is exactly how it would spend turns writing Tiptap documents
 * into pages that discard them. Two content types, two tool families.
 *
 * `content_post_create` (kind: "page") is still how a Page is CREATED — that part is genuinely
 * shared, since a Page's title/slug/status are ordinary entry metadata. Everything about its body
 * lives here.
