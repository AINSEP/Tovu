/**
 * @file Direct-call tests for `validateManifestV2`'s own contract, independent of its one current
 * caller (`validate-theme-package.ts`, which always resolves `schemaVersion` from
 * `raw.apiVersion === 2` before ever calling this function — see that file's `loadRawManifest`/
 * `validateThemePackage`). That gate makes `checkApiVersion`'s `v2-api-version` finding unreachable
 * through the one wired product path (verified 2026-08-20: a repo-wide grep for `validateManifestV2(`
 * turns up exactly that one call site, inside a branch already conditioned on the same equality).
 *
 * That is a caller-side fact about `validate-theme-package.ts`, not a fact about `validateManifestV2`
 * itself — this function is independently exported with no type-level tie to the gate (`raw` is a
 * plain `Record<string, unknown>`; nothing stops a future caller, or a test, from invoking it with an
 * `apiVersion` other than `2`). Per this repo's coverage-gap policy: a branch only unreachable through
 * one caller's current usage, not through the function's own public contract, gets a test, not a
 * deletion — this file is that test.
