/**
 * @file Loads deploy targets that Agent Plugins contribute — the generic seam that lets each hosting
 * plugin (and only plugins Tovu itself ships) add a hosting vendor without core naming one.
 *
 * A plugin opts in by shipping {@link DEPLOY_TARGETS_FILENAME} at its root: a data-only list of
 * `{ id, label, module }`. Each `module` is a plain-JS `.mjs` file inside the plugin whose default
 * export is a `DeployTargetModule` (`types.ts`).
 *
 * TRUST RULE (fail closed). Importing a module runs its code in this process, so a module is loaded
 * only when all of these hold (enforced by the shared gate, `features/agent-plugins/trusted-plugin-files.ts`):
 * 1. the plugin is ACTIVE by the fail-closed reader (`resolveAgentPluginActivation`) — an unreadable
 *    activation record refuses rather than reading as consent;
 * 2. its installed digest is the one `bundled-digests.json` records for it — the build's own seed,
 *    so an operator-installed package (or a tampered copy under a bundled id) never runs here
 *    (owner decision 2026-09-29: third-party hosts come later);
 * 3. the module path resolves inside the plugin root on disk (`assertContainedOnDisk`) and ends in
 *    `.mjs`, so no `package.json` above the install directory can make Node read it as CommonJS.
 *
 * Failure isolation: a bad plugin drops only its own targets, a bad module only itself, and a target
 * id two plugins both declare is dropped for both ("refusing to guess", as in
 * `resolve-agent-plugin-refs.ts`). Every drop is reported in `refusals`, never thrown.
 *
 * Architectural role: `features/deployments` capability, read by the static-publish adapter. Depends
 * on `features/agent-plugins` for installed-package discovery and trust; nothing depends back.
