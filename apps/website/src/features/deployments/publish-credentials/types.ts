/**
 * @file Domain types for named, workspace-scoped provider connections used to publish a static
 * export to a host plugin's deploy target (`publish_credential_sets`,
 * `src/platform/db/schema.sqlite.ts`). Design: `ADS-memory/reports/external-audit/runs/
 * 2026-08-15-terra-xhigh-publish-credentials-design.md`.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `PublishProviderId` is this codebase's ONE canonical 4-provider union — `../static-publish/
 * types.ts`'s `StaticPublishTargetId` is a type ALIAS of this union (not a second, independently
 * declared one), so the provider set can never drift between "what a credential can be saved for"
 * and "what a publish can target". This module owns the canonical declaration (not the other way
 * around) because a credential's provider identity is the more general, storage-shaped concept; a
 * one-shot publish operation borrows it, not the reverse.
 *
 * `PublishConnectionInput` is a CLOSED discriminated union on `providerId` — deliberately not an
 * open bag of optional fields, so a caller can never construct a connection with the wrong provider's
 * companion fields and have it silently ignored. Every host's required/optional split comes from
 * its plugin's descriptor (some need more than a bare token, e.g. an owner/repo or an account id,
 * HARD required — see `store.ts`'s `validateConnection`); other hosts' companion fields are
 * genuinely optional. Per-host notes on which stored companion fields a deploy target actually
 * reads live with the host plugin (`content/agent-plugins/<host>/NOTES.md`).
 *
 * A companion field is accepted and stored here even when, as of this pass, the host's deploy
 * target has nowhere to send it once decrypted. Storing it anyway keeps this module's contract
 * stable for whichever side (this store, or a future deploy-target change) ships second — see `../static-publish/adapter.ts`'s header for where this gap is flagged again at
 * the point it would actually matter (wiring a real publish).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Domain types only — no I/O, no sealer/keyring dependency. `store.ts` is the one place a
 * `PublishConnectionInput` is validated, serialized, and sealed. Since migration 0012 the sealed
 * connections are vendor vault rows, persisted through `VendorCredentialSetRepoPort`
 * (`../../vendor-credentials/types.ts`, which carries the `isDefault`/`updateAccountLabel` contract).
 */

/**
 * A saved connection: the target id plus the flat string fields that host's deploy-plugin descriptor
 * declares for its credential (`DeployTargetDescriptor.credential`), validated by `store.ts`. This
 * whole object is what gets serialized to JSON and sealed as ONE ciphertext blob per credential set
 * (never per-field columns — see `src/platform/db/schema.sqlite.ts`'s `publishCredentialSets` header
 * for why). The shape is byte-compatible with rows sealed before hosts moved into the plugin: same
 * `providerId`, same field names.
 *
 * Publish-TARGET settings (a repository, a team) are never credential fields: they are chosen per
 * publish run and live on the publish config.
