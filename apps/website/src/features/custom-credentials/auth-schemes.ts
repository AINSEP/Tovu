/**
 * @file Self-describing token schemes: tokens that carry their own `Authorization` scheme word as a
 * leading prefix (a vendor token such as `<Scheme><rest>` must be sent as `Authorization: <Scheme>
 * <rest>`, and is rejected when sent as `Bearer <whole token>`). Core names no vendor: the rules are
 * DATA that Agent Plugins ship in {@link CREDENTIAL_SCHEMES_FILENAME}, and Jini applies them.
 * The `deploy` plugin ships the one rule known today, with its live-verification
 * evidence in the file's `note`.
 *
 * Recognition is by the token's own content, never by the credential's saved host: a
 * `custom_credential_sets` row has no provider id (only an operator-typed label, base URL and token),
 * and a credential saved with a proxied base URL still carries the same self-describing token.
 * Dispatch is try-each-in-turn, first match wins, so rules should keep their prefixes disjoint.
 *
 * TRUST GATES (`features/agent-plugins/trusted-plugin-files.ts`). The bundled-digest gate applies:
 * only a plugin package this build shipped may add a rule, since a rule decides how a saved secret is
 * sent. The activation gate deliberately does NOT apply: a rule is inert data (no code runs), and a
 * saved credential that already works must keep working unchanged when an operator switches the
 * contributing plugin off. Switching `deploy` off hides deploy tools; it must not silently turn a
 * working credential's header into one its provider rejects.
 *
 * Architectural role: `features/custom-credentials` capability, read by `credentialed-request.ts`.
 * Depends on `features/agent-plugins` for installed-package discovery and trust.
 *
 * Contract rationale for the Jini implementation and this host boundary:
 *
 * One scheme rule: a token starting with `prefix` (case-sensitive, with at least one character after
 *  it) is sent as `Authorization: <scheme> <rest of the token>`. `id` is bookkeeping only.
 *
 * One recognized self-describing token: the `scheme` word to send, and the `value` that follows it
 *  in the token (everything after the prefix, unmodified).
 *
 * The rules a workspace's trusted plugins contribute, plus every file or rule that was dropped.
 *
 * An HTTP auth-scheme name is an RFC 9110 `token`.
 *
 * Returns the first rule whose `prefix` is a genuine leading prefix of `token` (case-sensitive) with
 * at least one character left after it, or `null`. A token that IS exactly the prefix has no
 * credential value left to send and falls through to ordinary Bearer/Basic handling, as does a token
 * that merely contains a prefix later in the string. Pure.
 *
 * @complexity O(r) rules, each one `startsWith`.
 *
 * Parses a plugin's {@link CREDENTIAL_SCHEMES_FILENAME}. Pure; the parser is exported by Jini for direct tests. Unknown
 * keys (such as a rule's `note`) are ignored.
 *
 * @complexity O(r) in the declared rule count.
 *
 * One rule entry, or the reason it is invalid. @complexity O(1).
