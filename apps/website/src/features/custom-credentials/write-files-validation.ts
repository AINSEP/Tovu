/**
 * @file Shape/path/size validation for `custom_credential_write_files` — every check here runs
 * BEFORE the credential is resolved or any network call is made, mirroring this domain's own
 * established ordering (`tool-registrations.ts`'s `rejectUnexpectedSetTokenFields`/
 * `requireUsernameOrClearSentinel` both run before `requireToolPermission`/any I/O) and
 * `features/agent-plugins/package-paths.ts`'s "cheap majority of attempts caught before any
 * filesystem call" split.
 *
 * Owner and repo are the one exception to "before the credential is resolved": their rules belong to
 * the git host (`features/source-control/repository-target.ts`: the host plugin's own
 * `validateTarget`, then a generic one-path-segment rule), and the host is known only from the saved
 * credential's base URL. So {@link validateRepositoryTarget} runs once the caller has picked the
 * provider from that URL, still before any decrypt, network call or dialog.
 *
 * `BRANCH_PATTERN`/`MAX_COMMIT_MESSAGE_LENGTH` are byte-identical to
 * `features/source-control/commit-site.ts`'s own constants of the same name — copied, not imported,
 * per this codebase's established convention for a tiny cross-feature constant.
 *
 * The path-safety rule set is the LEXICAL half of `package-paths.ts`'s `normalizePackageEntryPath`
 * (reject NUL, absolute paths, a Windows drive prefix, `..` segments) — never its filesystem half
 * (`assertContainedOnDisk`'s `realpath` containment check), because there is no local filesystem
 * write here to protect: every validated path becomes a `path` field in a git-tree entry on the host, a
 * remote API call this process never resolves against its own disk. One rule has no
 * `package-paths.ts` analog: a normalized path that IS (or is nested under) `.git` — case-insensitively
 * — is refused outright. That directory name is git's own reserved metadata location; committing a
 * tracked FILE at a path like `.git/config` or `.GIT/hooks/pre-commit` is exactly the shape of the
 * case-insensitive-filesystem `.git` collision class git itself started refusing at clone/checkout
 * time (CVE-2021-21300 and related) — refusing it here, at write time, is cheap and closes the same
 * hole from the other direction for any client that has not been patched.

 *
 * - `maxFiles`: the confirmation dialog this tool opens (`write-files-confirmation-ui.ts`) lists
 *   every path by name so a human can actually read and approve each one before anything is written;
 *   past a few dozen rows that review stops being real. The one caller that exists today (the
 *   `deploy` plugin's skill) writes exactly 2 files. 25 is generous headroom above that for any plausible
 *   future caller while keeping the dialog reviewable.
 * - `maxPathLength`: far beyond any real repository path, while still bounding one hostile field.
 * - `maxFileBytes`: every known caller writes small hand-authored or LLM-authored text config
 *   (a platform config file, a GitHub Actions workflow YAML) — 1 MiB is generous for that class of file while
 *   keeping a single blob-creation request body bounded.
 * - `maxTotalBytes`: bounds the call's AGGREGATE payload independent of how the per-file cap is
 *   split across files — the same "per-item cap AND total cap" shape `agent-plugins/install.ts`'s
 *   `maxFileBytes`/`maxTotalExtractedBytes` pair uses for the identical reason.
