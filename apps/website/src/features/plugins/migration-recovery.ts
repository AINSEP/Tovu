/**
 * @file ADR-023 §2 — boot-time crash recovery for the dataModule engine, on the storage kernel.
 * The site opener calls {@link recoverIncompleteDataModuleMigrations} right after it opens the
 * content database and before anything else reads it — before the SQLite migrations run.
 *
 * Any journal entry not in a terminal phase (`COMMITTED`/`ROLLED_BACK`) is a crash-interrupted
 * attempt — mandatory, blocking:
 * - SQLite: the caller's `restoreSnapshots` closes its connection and restores each entry's
 *   snapshot file ({@link restoreSqliteSnapshots}); the caller then reopens. No restore ever runs
 *   against a file a connection still holds open (T2/T8's corruption vector).
 * - Postgres/PGlite: DDL and the journal commit in one transaction, so an incomplete entry can only
 *   be an attempt whose transaction rolled back. Nothing to restore; the entry is marked
 *   `ROLLED_BACK`.

 * Finds and settles every crash-interrupted dataModule attempt in `store`'s database. A database
 * with no journal table yet has none.
 *
 * NOTE (SQLite): the journal entry itself is NOT marked `ROLLED_BACK` post-restore. The journal row
 * was inserted AFTER the snapshot it references was taken (§2's phase sequence starts at
 * `PREPARED_SNAPSHOT`, meaning "the snapshot already exists"), so the snapshot never contains that
 * row — restoring from it reverts the live file to a state that has no record of the interrupted
 * attempt at all, which is correct (the attempt is fully undone). The returned `entries` list IS the
 * audit record for this boot's recovery action; the caller must log it.
 *
 * @param required.restoreSnapshots SQLite only: close the connection under `store`, then restore
 *   the entries' snapshots (normally {@link restoreSqliteSnapshots}). `store` is unusable after it.
