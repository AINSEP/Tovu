/**
 * @file The open provider registry (architecture review §4.5).
 *
 * WooCommerce's registry is genuinely open — core never enumerates gateways, providers add
 * themselves — but its execution is an array of class-name STRINGS passed through a filter and
 * `new $gateway()`'d, where a missing class is skipped with a bare `continue` and core's own
 * registry still carries a hard-coded branch for one gateway. This keeps the openness and drops
 * that: registration takes a constructed object, validates it once, and fails loudly at
 * composition time rather than silently at checkout time.
 *
 * Registration failures THROW, unlike every method on `PaymentProvider` itself. The distinction is
 * deliberate: a bad registration is a composition-root programming error discovered at boot, in
 * the same class as `activateDeploy` throwing on a failed dataModule declaration. A bad *payment*
 * is a runtime condition a caller must be able to handle, which is why it is a typed
 * `PaymentError` instead.

 * both derivations injective and free of escaping concerns.
