 * Enforced in CODE, not in the schema: `declareDataModule()` supports no `CHECK` constraint
 * (ADR-023's declared grammar is columns + indexes only), so this module is the single chokepoint
 * that decides whether a transition is legal. That is the same "chokepoint-validated, not
 * FK-enforced (v1)" posture ADR-031 §2 already takes, and it is safe only while lipay is the sole
 * writer through one connection — a real ceiling, and it is money (review R3).
 *
 * WooCommerce's equivalent guard is `has_status()` applied at three separate layers with no
 * transaction spanning them and a third-party-filterable status set — a read-then-write TOCTOU.
 * Here the check runs inside the same `db.transaction()` as the write it guards.

 * event is still recorded in `p_lipay__events` for operator follow-up, which is the honest
 * outcome rather than forcing it into `refunded` (a chargeback is not a refund: the money is
 * pulled by the issuer, and the merchant's dispute rights differ). `expired` maps to `canceled`:
 * an expired out-of-band charge (PIX/boleto/USSD window elapsed) can never complete, and
