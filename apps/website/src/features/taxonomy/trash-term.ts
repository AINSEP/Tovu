/**
 * @file Deleting a term or a taxonomy = moving it to the Trash (T6, trash parallel plan §2, owner
 * decision 5). Same shape as `features/forms/delete-submission.ts`'s `deleteFormSubmission`: the
 * Trash itself is injected as `remove` (bound to `"term"`/`"taxonomy"` at the composition root),
 * so this file never imports `features/trash` (binding rule 2 — domains never import from trash).
 *
 * This REPLACES the route's use of `@jini-ai/cms/taxonomy`'s `deleteTerm`/`deleteTaxonomy` (a hard
 * delete, guarded by "has children" / "has assigned content"). Those two functions still exist and
 * are still exported from the package — `repo.sqlite.integration.test.ts` still exercises them
 * directly to prove the guarded-hard-delete behavior itself, and `Jini is off-limits` (the plan)
 * means their guard ladder is not something this dispatch touches — the route (this dispatch's
 * scope) simply stops calling them. An assigned term or taxonomy IS trashable: decision 5 removes
 * the "has assigned content" refusal entirely, so only `term`'s child-term blocker survives, as the
 * Trash's own generic `TERM_HAS_CHILDREN` (`registry.ts`'s `blocker`).
