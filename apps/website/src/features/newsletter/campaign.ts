/**
 * @file `transitionCampaignStatus` — the campaign status-machine guard (ADR-PIPE-011 C-008,
 * behavior.spec.md §1.1, REQ-04/05/07/18).
 *
 * `[internal-invariant]`: a divergence between this function and any route-layer re-implementation
 * of the transition-authority rule is a fail-open authorization bug, same class as SPEC-007's
 * `deriveRequiredPermission` (ADR-PIPE-011 Contract Map C-008). `campaign-write-service.ts` calls
 * this before every status-affecting write; no other call site may re-implement it.
 *
 * Precedence (highest to lowest — behavior.spec.md §1.1's transition-authority table):
 * 1. `pipeline` tier (the send pipeline's own internal actions, never a direct HTTP caller) —
 *    the ONLY actor that may set `scheduled -> sending` or `sending -> sent`.
 * 2. `send` tier (`admin.newsletter.campaign.send`) — may set `sending <-> paused` only (via
 *    `PAUSE_CAMPAIGN`/`RESUME_CAMPAIGN`); never sets `sending`/`sent` directly (those stay
 *    pipeline-only, reached only by triggering `authorizeSend`, which runs as `pipeline` tier).
 * 3. `schedule` tier (`admin.newsletter.campaign.schedule`) — may set `draft -> scheduled` only
 *    (via `SCHEDULE_CAMPAIGN`).
 * 4. `compose` tier (`admin.newsletter.campaign.compose`) — may set `draft -> canceled` or
 *    `scheduled -> canceled` only (via `CANCEL_CAMPAIGN`); `UPDATE_CAMPAIGN`'s body schema does not
 *    accept a `status` field at all (no direct status transition from plain field edits).
 *
 * DEVIATION DISCLOSED: `api.spec.md` has no dedicated "unschedule"/revert-to-draft endpoint in its
 * 19-route list — only `CANCEL_CAMPAIGN`/`SCHEDULE_CAMPAIGN`/`SEND_CAMPAIGN`/`SEND_TEST_CAMPAIGN`/
 * `PAUSE_CAMPAIGN`/`RESUME_CAMPAIGN` exist. This implementation therefore maps each real endpoint to
 * exactly one transition family and does NOT implement a `scheduled -> draft` transition for any
 * tier (there is no endpoint that would call it). If a future endpoint needs that transition, add it
 * here explicitly rather than widening `compose`'s existing grant.
