/**
 * @file `resolveClaimConflicts()` — product-neutral detection of two extensions claiming the same
 * named thing (a route, a tool name, a table, a setting id, a widget id, a permission id, an
 * exclusive hook).
 *
 * JINI CANDIDATE: nothing in this file knows about Tovu, its manifest, its plugins or its storage —
 * it takes owners and their claims as plain data and returns who keeps what. It belongs in
 * `@jini-ai/plugins` (or `@jini-ai/core`) beside the glue capability gates. Not moved yet because
 * Tovu's deploy build resolves `@jini-ai/*` from the published registry, so a Jini-side copy would be
 * unreachable from production until the owner publishes; moving it is a file move plus one import.
 *
 * ## The rules (also in `ADS-memory/specs/005-plugin-system/conflicts.spec.md`)
 *
 * 1. Owners are processed in PRECEDENCE order — the caller's order, first wins. Core goes first;
 *    after that the caller decides (Tovu: earliest-enabled first, so the NEWER plugin is the one
 *    refused — the plugin that was already working keeps working).
 * 2. A claim is `exclusive` (only one owner may hold it) or `shared` (any number of owners may hold
 *    it together — a filter pipeline hook where every filter runs in a fixed order is the example).
 *    An exclusive claim conflicts with ANY other owner's claim on the same slot, shared or not; two
 *    shared claims never conflict.
 * 3. A REFUSED owner contributes nothing: if A holds `x`, B is refused for `x`, and C claims B's
 *    other key `y`, C is accepted. Refusal is all-or-nothing per owner — half a plugin is not a
 *    state anyone can reason about, so an owner with any conflict keeps none of its claims.
 * 4. One owner claiming the same slot twice is not a conflict (a manifest repeating itself is a
 *    validation concern, not a collision between two parties).
 * 5. Keys are compared after the kind's normalization (see {@link DEFAULT_CLAIM_KIND_RULES}):
 *    identifiers are case-insensitive; a route is `METHOD /path` with parameter names erased
 *    (`/a/:id` and `/a/{slug}` are the same route) and `*`/`ANY` meaning every method.
 * 6. A key ending in `*` is a PREFIX claim: it holds every key that starts with what precedes the
 *    `*`. Core uses this to reserve whole namespaces (`/api/*`, `admin.*`) without listing every
 *    name in them; an exact claim inside a held prefix conflicts, and so does a prefix claim that
 *    covers a held exact key or overlaps a held prefix.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no clock, no mutation of its input.
