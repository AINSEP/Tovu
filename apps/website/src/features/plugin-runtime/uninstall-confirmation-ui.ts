 * @file The dialog `plugins_uninstall` raises before it removes anything.
 *
 * Same held-open exchange as `set-enabled-confirmation-ui.ts` (this domain's own sibling) and
 * `agent-plugins/uninstall-confirmation-ui.ts` (the OTHER plugin family's identical dialog): the
 * model's one call parks, and only the browser POST to `mcp-ui-tool-calls-route.ts` can resolve it
 * (ADR-055 Decision 2; `post/delete-confirmation-ui.ts` has the full chain). So `plugins_uninstall`
 * must also be on `assistant/mcp-ui-tool-calls.ts`'s `MCP_UI_REDEEMABLE_TOOL_IDS`, or every
 * Confirm/Cancel click 403s.
 *
 * This file is deliberately its own module rather than a shared one with `agent-plugins/
 * uninstall-confirmation-ui.ts`: the two plugin families' wording, warnings, and preview shapes
 * genuinely differ (a site plugin's artifact is shared across every workspace this instance serves;
 * an Agent Plugin's is per-workspace), and a shared builder would either blur that difference or grow
 * a family-switch branch neither side asked for.
