/**
 * What a caller must still do after a successful toggle, per family and direction.
 *
 * This exists because "enabled: true" alone was actively misleading. The activation record is
 * durable and re-read per run, so the GATE moves immediately — but a plugin's own tool
 * (`agent_plugin_<id>` for Agent Plugins, a capability tool for site plugins) is registered once, at
 * agent-daemon boot, and the `search_tools` index is a one-shot snapshot taken right after
 * (`agent-daemon-server.ts`). So a freshly enabled plugin's TOOL is not callable in the daemon that
 * is running now. Reporting plain success and letting the operator discover that themselves is the
 * confusion this field exists to prevent.
 *
 * The two directions are deliberately NOT symmetric, for BOTH families, and the notes say so. DISABLE
 * lands immediately on the tool as well, because each tool's own `ToolPolicy` re-reads the activation
 * record per call: `agent_plugin_<id>` via `features/agent-plugins/tool-registrations.ts`'s REVOCATION
 * note, `plugin_capability_<id>` via `capability-tool-registrations.ts`'s "Revocation" section
 * (t91 F1.2). ENABLE still needs a restart, because there is no registration to re-admit: an
 * append-only `ToolRegistry` has nothing to un-skip.
 *
 * An Agent Plugin's provisioned connection rows and credentials survive disable: deleting those
 * records would destroy a sign-in the owner already earned (`federate-mcp.ts`, "THE ROW SURVIVES").
 * Retention is not permission: the connection's per-call gate now also checks the provisioning
 * plugin's activation, and reload withdraws its frozen registrations from discovery. The note must
 * distinguish saved credentials from callable tools so the model cannot keep using an OFF plugin.
 * @complexity O(1).
