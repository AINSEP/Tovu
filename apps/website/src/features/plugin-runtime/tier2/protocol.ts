/**
 * @file The Tier-2 plugin ABI wire protocol (ADR-024 §3/§4): what the server sends a fresh worker

 * functions, no class instances, no live core objects — because they cross a `worker_threads`
 * boundary, and because the same messages must later cross a real process sandbox unchanged.
 *
 * One request = one fresh worker: import the plugin, run `setup()` against a fresh
 * capability-scoped SDK, then either report which hooks it attached (`probe`, run once at enable
 * time) or run its beforeSave filter on one entry (`beforeSave`, run per save/preview).
