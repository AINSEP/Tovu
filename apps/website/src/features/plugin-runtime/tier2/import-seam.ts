/**
 * @file `createTier2ImportSeam()` — the `importModule` a Tier-2 plugin's `loadPlugin()` call is
 * given (ADR-024 §3/§4). It never imports the plugin's code into the server process. Instead it
 * probes the plugin in a fresh worker (import + setup + report attached hooks) and returns a
 * PROXY `definePlugin()` module whose `setup()` attaches an RPC filter: each filter call is one
 * more fresh worker that imports, sets up, runs the real filter and replies.
 *
 * Injected through `loadPlugin()`'s own `importModule` option, so CIC U-001 is untouched: integrity
 * and sdkRange are verified before this function is ever called (it IS step 3), and the proxy then
 * goes through the same export validation, capability-scoped `setup()` and attach path as an
 * in-process plugin. Probe failures are mapped onto the loader's own reasons rather than new ones:
 * a failed import rejects (`CODE_ENTRY_MISSING`), a missing export returns a module without one
 * (`PLUGIN_EXPORT_INVALID`), a failed setup returns a proxy whose setup throws (`PLUGIN_SETUP_FAILED`).
 *
 * A failed or timed-out filter call throws, so `hook-registry.ts` fails the save closed and counts
 * the failure toward quarantine exactly as it does for a throwing Tier-3 filter.
