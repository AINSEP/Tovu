/**
 * @file `buildCapabilityScopedSdk()` — builds the per-load `PluginSdk` handle (SPEC-005 REQ-04;
 * CIC U-003, `ESCALATE_SECURITY`).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * REQ-04: "the SDK object handed to the plugin exposes ONLY the granted surface. A plugin
 * invoking a surface it did not declare fails at the SDK boundary (`CAPABILITY_DENIED`)."
 *
 * **CIC U-003 (Binding, ESCALATE_SECURITY):** a naive reading of REQ-04 could satisfy "exposes
 * only the granted surface" by simply OMITTING ungranted properties (`sdk.content = granted ?
 * {...} : undefined`). That is the wrong implementation — AC-05's contract requires a classified,
 * catchable `CAPABILITY_DENIED` error, not a bare `TypeError` from calling a method on
 * `undefined`. This function must therefore always expose a callable at every one of the three
 * v1 capability positions (`content.read`, `content.extend`, `addFilter`) — granted capabilities
 * get the real implementation (delegating to `coreDeps`), ungranted capabilities get a stub that
 * SYNCHRONOUSLY throws a typed `CapabilityDeniedError` naming the missing capability. Any
 * deviation from "always present, never absent" requires a recorded
 * `[CIC_DEVIATION_APPROVED]` entry — see
 * `reports/pipeline/005-plugin-system/critical-internal-constraints.md` U-003.
 *
 * Built fresh per plugin load (never a shared module-level singleton, ADR Decision item 2) — a
 * new `PluginSdk` object is constructed for every `loadPlugin()` call, closing over that one
 * plugin's own `pluginId` and granted capability set only.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * TDD-certified implementation (implementation outline C-009, CIC U-003). Signature and JSDoc are
 * design-frozen; `buildCapabilityScopedSdk()` returns fresh per-plugin delegates for granted
 * capabilities and present, typed-denial stubs for every ungranted surface.
