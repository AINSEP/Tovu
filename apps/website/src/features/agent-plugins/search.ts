/**
 * @file Pure relevance ranking for `search_agent_plugin_local` — turns one workspace's already-
 * resolved installed Agent Plugins into scored matches for a free-text query. No filesystem or
 * network I/O; `tool-registrations.ts` is the caller that reads disk and hands this module already-
 * resolved {@link AgentPluginSearchCandidate}s.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why field-weighted substring matching, not FTS5/BM25
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `assistant/tool-catalog-query.ts` (the `search_tools` index this tool itself is found through)
 * seeds a real SQLite FTS5 table because its catalog is runtime-registered and can be large (170+
 * tools, changing per boot/workspace). The catalog THIS function ranks over is different in kind:
 * one workspace's own installed Agent Plugins, read fresh off disk on every call, realistically a
 * handful of entries. `assistant/component-catalog-query.ts` (`search_components`) already
 * establishes the house precedent for exactly this shape — "a handful of manifests doesn't warrant
 * a database for substring matching" — and ranks with plain `haystack.includes(term)` scoring. This
 * module reuses that same technique rather than inventing a second one, with one deliberate
 * difference from that precedent: per-field WEIGHTS instead of one flat merged haystack.
 *
 * The weights are not decorative. `plugin.json` (agent-plugins.org) carries a `keywords` array
 * that `component-catalog-query.ts`'s manifests have no equivalent of — author-curated discovery
 * terms, the exact same "operator asks in different words than the code uses" gap
 * `tool-search-keywords.ts`'s own header describes at length for native tools. A keyword hit is a
 * stronger, more deliberate signal than an incidental word landing inside free-form prose, so it is
 * scored higher. The id (`pluginId`) is scored highest of all: it is what a caller actually types
 * back to `plugins_set_enabled`-shaped tools next, so an exact or near match on it (a caller typing
 * "site-compliance" or "compliance") must win outright — mirroring `tool-catalog.ts`'s own
 * documented "id weighted 6x description" ratio for the identical reason (id IS the thing quoted
 * back). Skill name/summary text is weighted lowest: it is the broadest, noisiest vocabulary (every
 * bundled skill's own frontmatter description folded in), valuable for recall on a query that names
 * a capability rather than a plugin ("shadcn components") but not something that should let one
 * verbose plugin outrank a plugin whose own id/keywords/description directly named the query.
 * Plugin `description` sits in between: real author prose, but not curated tags and not the
 * identity string itself.
 *
 * A plugin's own `version`, `enabled` state, and MCP server ids are carried through on every match
 * for the caller to report, but are NOT scored — none of them are text a caller plausibly searches
 * for ("find me the plugin on version 1.1.0" is not a real query), and an MCP server id is often an
 * arbitrary machine-chosen string with no natural-language relationship to what an operator would
 * type.
 *
 * @complexity `rankInstalledAgentPlugins` is O(c * t * f) — c candidates, t query terms, f fields
 * (a fixed constant, 4) — so effectively O(c * t): linear in the installed-plugin count and query
 * length, both small and locally bounded (there is no user-controlled upper bound on installed-
 * plugin count today, matching the same unbounded-but-locally-small shape
 * `loadInstalledAgentPluginToolSources` already accepts for the very same catalog).
