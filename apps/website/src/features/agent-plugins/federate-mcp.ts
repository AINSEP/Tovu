/**
 * @file Phase 4 of the 2026-09-10 plugin-MCP-wiring work: PROVISIONS an activated Agent Plugin's
 * auto-admitted remote MCP servers as real rows in the SAME external-MCP store
 * (`assistant/external-mcp-store.ts`) Settings → External MCP already owns — reusing that path
 * rather than building a parallel one. A provisioned row appears in Settings → External MCP exactly
 * like an operator-typed one: the same allowlist/"may write" tool picker, the same enable toggle,
 * the same revoke button. There is no second, plugin-only registration path.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 2026-09-10, owner refinement — three collision rules, and why each exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A `higgsfield` row already exists on the live dev site with connected OAuth tokens, an allowlist,
 * and write grants — created by hand, by an operator following the bundled skill's old instructions,
 * before this file existed. That row is the concrete case every rule below defends:
 *
 * 1. **NEVER CLOBBER AN EXISTING ROW — ADOPT IT INSTEAD.** {@link provisionAgentPluginMcpServers}
 *    calls `deps.repo.findByServerId` BEFORE ever calling {@link saveExternalMcpServer}. A row
 *    already at the derived id is NEVER passed through {@link saveExternalMcpServer} — no field an
 *    operator or an earlier boot wrote (url, transport, auth mode, allowlist, write grants, any
 *    oauth/sealed column) is ever recomputed or overwritten here. This is why
 *    {@link deriveAgentPluginConnectionId} below no longer hashes or namespaces the id: an id
 *    genuinely equal to what an operator would have hand-typed (the plugin's own declared server
 *    key, e.g. `higgsfield`) is what lets this rule recognize the ACTUAL pre-existing row, rather
 *    than shadowing it with a second, uniquely-derived connection beside it. There is deliberately no
 *    hash-suffixed fallback id — one id, verbatim, always; a vendor's own SKILL.md documents
 *    `mcp__<serverKey>__<tool>` and cannot predict any suffix Tovu might mint, so a fallback scheme
 *    would defeat the exact "no guessing" goal this feature exists for.
 *
 *    A row already at that id splits into two cases, neither of which ever calls
 *    `saveExternalMcpServer`:
 *      - `provisionedByPluginId === input.pluginId` — this same plugin provisioned it on an earlier
 *        enable; nothing has changed. Reported {@link ProvisionAgentPluginMcpServersResult
 *        .alreadyProvisioned}.
 *      - anything else (`null`, or a DIFFERENT plugin's id) — an operator's own hand-configured
 *        connection (with its earned OAuth tokens, allowlist, and write grants), or another plugin's
 *        row. This is ADOPTION: `deps.repo.upsert({ ...existing, provisionedByPluginId: input.pluginId })`
 *        is called directly against the repo port — the raw record, spread, with only that one field
 *        changed — never `saveExternalMcpServer`, which has no way to leave every other field
 *        untouched while changing just this one (even its "tri-state" fields resolve a default the
 *        caller must supply). Reported {@link ProvisionAgentPluginMcpServersResult.adopted}. The
 *        operator's own configuration and any live tokens always outrank a package's declaration —
 *        that is this rule, applied to the id-collision case specifically.
 *      - EXCEPT a row owned by a DIFFERENT plugin whose url, transport, or auth mode DIFFERS from the
 *        declaration — a different server whose key merely normalized to the same id. Rewriting that
 *        plugin's provenance would leave calls for this plugin pointing at the other plugin's
 *        endpoint, so the collision is refused, never adopted, and reported
 *        {@link ProvisionAgentPluginMcpServersResult.failed}. Two plugins declaring the identical key
 *        AND endpoint therefore share one row (whichever enabled most recently owns
 *        `provisionedByPluginId`); two declaring the same key but different endpoints do not. An
 *        operator's row (`provisionedByPluginId === null`) is still adopted unconditionally — the
 *        operator typed the endpoint they wanted, so recording the association is not a rewrite of
 *        another plugin's provenance.
 *    KNOWN RACE: the existence check and the create/adopt are not one atomic operation (no
 *    compare-and-set primitive exists on `ExternalMcpServerRepoPort` today, unlike
 *    `tryClaimOAuthRefreshLease`'s purpose-built one). Two concurrent provisioning attempts for the
 *    SAME id are harmless — creation races write the identical disabled/empty-allowlist config, and
 *    adoption races both write the same one field. A provisioning attempt racing an operator's
 *    concurrent hand-edit of the same id is the one real gap, and it is the same class of risk any two
 *    concurrent saves to this store already have — not a new one, but also not eliminated by this
 *    file. Closing it fully needs a new repo primitive, deliberately not added here as disproportionate
 *    to this feature's scope.
 *
 * 2. **SEED DISABLED, LIKE BUNDLED PLUGINS ALREADY DO.** Mirrors `activation.ts`'s
 *    `recordBundledAgentPluginIfAbsent`: idempotent, create-if-absent, and — because rule 1 already
 *    means an existing row is never revisited — a row this file created is never re-enabled by a
 *    later boot or a later plugin toggle either. `enabled: false` is passed on the ONE
 *    {@link saveExternalMcpServer} call that creates a brand-new row; there is no code path here that
 *    ever sets `enabled: true` on any row, new or existing.
 *
 * 3. **PROVISIONING IS NOT AUTHORIZATION.** `allowedToolNames`/`writeAllowedToolNames` are always
 *    `""` on a newly created row, even though a plugin's `mcp.json`/skill content might suggest
 *    names. A downloaded marketplace package must not be able to grant itself tool access — the same
 *    trust argument Phase 3's stdio split makes, applied here to the allowlist instead of to
 *    execution. The operator ticks tools in Settings → External MCP's picker, which already lets
 *    them choose from a live, server-advertised list (`probe.ts`) rather than guessing names.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What happens on plugin disable or uninstall: THE ROW SURVIVES
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing in this file, and nothing this dispatch added to `set-enabled.ts` or
 * `features/agent-plugins/uninstall.ts`, ever deletes or disables a provisioned row when its plugin
 * is turned off or removed. This is a deliberate position, not an oversight: a provisioned row may
 * already hold OAuth tokens the operator earned through a real browser sign-in, and deleting an
 * external MCP connection is UNRECOVERABLE in this app (`project_external_mcp_delete_is_unrecoverable`
 * — no soft-delete, no undo). Silently destroying that on a disable/uninstall would be a strictly
 * worse failure mode than leaving an inert, disabled row behind. `provisioned_by_plugin_id`
 * (`schema.ts`) records which plugin created a surviving row, so a FUTURE uninstall flow can offer
 * to remove it explicitly — an operator decision, never an automatic side effect of this file.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What this does NOT do
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - Never touches a `stdio` server. `classifyAgentPluginMcpServerTrust` (`capability-projection.ts`)
 *   is consulted first, and only an `"auto-admit"` (remote) server ever reaches
 *   {@link saveExternalMcpServer}. There is no code path in this file that can launch a local
 *   process on a plugin's say-so — see Phase 3's own gate for the full argument.
 * - Never completes an OAuth handshake. `authMode: "oauth"` rows still need the operator's own
 *   browser-interactive consent (Higgsfield's authorization_code + PKCE flow has no other kind) —
 *   this file only makes sure the row EXISTS with the right URL and transport so that consent step
 *   is the operator's only remaining action.
 * - Does not run at request time and makes no live network call. Only the row's own data is
 *   written. The daemon's boot-time federation read (`resolveStoredExternalMcpConnections`) is what
 *   actually connects, and per that module's own doc, requires an assistant restart to pick up a
 *   newly-provisioned (and since-enabled) row.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why authMode defaults to "none", not "oauth"
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The real Agent Plugins v1.0.0 mcp.schema.json defines NO auth field at all (verified live,
 * 2026-09-10 — see `manifest.ts`'s header). Guessing "oauth" for every remote server would attempt
 * RFC 8414 discovery against a plugin's server even when it needs no auth at all, failing where a
 * plain connection would have worked. `"none"` is the safe default; a plugin author who KNOWS their
 * server requires OAuth (Higgsfield's own `mcp.json` does) sets the `tovuAuthMode` extension
 * (`manifest.ts`) to say so explicitly.
