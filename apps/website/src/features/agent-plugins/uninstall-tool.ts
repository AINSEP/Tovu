/**
 * @file The Agent Plugin family's half of `plugins_uninstall` (S4, 2026-09-24).
 *
 * Before this file existed, this was its own standalone tool, `agent_plugins_uninstall`
 * (`features/agent-plugins/tool-registrations.ts`). `features/plugin-runtime/tool-registrations.ts`
 * already has `plugins_uninstall` for the OTHER plugin system (`.tovu-plugin` site/runtime plugins),
 * and a model choosing between two near-identically-named uninstall tools is the exact confusion
 * `plugins_set_enabled`'s own family merge (2026-09-09) already fixed for enable/disable — uninstall
 * had the identical problem and got the identical fix: ONE tool, a required `family` argument, this
 * module supplying the Agent Plugin branch.
 *
 * `runAgentPluginUninstall` below is everything `plugins_uninstall`'s handler
 * (`plugin-runtime/tool-registrations.ts`) needs to run the Agent Plugin branch: permission check,
 * preview-or-refusal, the confirmation dialog, and the confirmed write. Behavior is UNCHANGED from the
 * deleted standalone tool — same permanent removal, same dialog, same refusals — only the id it is
 * reached through changed. See that file's own header for the full design this mirrors (no
 * cross-workspace "enabled somewhere else" precondition; bundled is refused for permanence, not mere
 * absence).
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT import `agent-plugins/tool-registrations.ts` — that file's own header states
 * "no plugin-runtime -> agent-plugins/tool-registrations edge", and this module is `plugin-runtime`'s
 * new entry point into this family, so it must not create the edge from the other side either.
 *
 * Risk classification: `deletes-durable-state`, same as the deleted standalone tool. See
 * `plugin-runtime/tool-registrations.ts`'s `pluginsDerivedRisk` for where that is now declared for the
 * merged `plugins_uninstall` id — one id, one risk band, covering the worse of the two families' blast
 * radii (site plugins go to the Trash; Agent Plugins do not).
