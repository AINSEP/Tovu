/**
 * @file The per-workspace ledger of WHICH installed digest each bundled Agent Plugin currently
 * ships as — written by `seed-bundled.ts` on every boot, read by the surfaces that have to pick one
 * installed package for a plugin id.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The gap this closes
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `packages/sha256/<digest>/` is content-addressed and nothing retires an entry, so shipping a NEW
 * VERSION of an already-installed bundled plugin lands it ALONGSIDE the old one. Both consumption
 * surfaces then refuse that plugin outright as ambiguous — `resolve-agent-plugin-refs.ts`'s
 * "refusing to guess which one to use" and `tool-registrations.ts`'s `poisonedPluginIds`. A product
 * upgrade therefore broke every enabled bundled plugin whose bytes it touched, silently, on the next
 * boot. Observed live: `higgsfield-media` (2 digests, enabled, tools gone), `supabase` (3 digests,
 * dormant), and `github` one boot away from the same fate.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a ledger rather than deleting, or than "prefer the newest"
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The ambiguity refusal itself is deliberate and stays exactly as it was — `resolve-agent-plugin-
 * refs.ts`'s header argues at length that silently picking one (the lexicographically-last, the
 * newest mtime, whatever hashed later) would be a WORSE failure mode than an explicit error, because
 * a wrong plugin's content would reach the agent and nothing about the run would look wrong. That
 * reasoning is untouched here. What changes is that for a BUNDLED plugin there is now something
 * authoritative to consult instead of guessing: the build's own seed recorded which digest it
 * published. A digest wins because Tovu shipped it, never because it sorted first.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating plainly, because each one is a refusal this file deliberately
 * keeps:
 *
 * 1. **An id with no ledger entry is still ambiguous.** Two digests of a plugin the seeder never
 *    seeded — an operator's own installs — remain an explicit error. Nothing here has any authority
 *    over a package Tovu did not put on disk.
 * 2. **A ledger entry that names a digest which is not installed decides nothing.** The named digest
 *    has to be present, and be exactly one of the candidates, or the ambiguity stands.
 * 3. **An unreadable ledger reads as an empty one.** That is fail-CLOSED here, unlike
 *    `activation.ts`'s own lenient reader: an empty ledger names no winner, so every ambiguity stays
 *    an error. This file can only ever resolve an ambiguity, never create one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Nothing is deleted, moved, or renamed
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A superseded digest's bytes stay exactly where they are. Retiring by moving directories out of a
 * live `packages/sha256/` at boot was the other candidate design and was rejected: it mutates the
 * operator's package store on a code path whose whole job is supposed to be idempotent, it races
 * anything mid-read, and — since a digest's provenance is NOT recorded per-digest anywhere — a
 * workspace that already held an operator's own install under a bundled plugin's id could have had
 * that operator's bytes moved aside by an inference. Preferring a digest at READ time disturbs
 * nothing and is undone by deleting one small JSON file. The cost is disk: superseded packages
 * accumulate until an operator prunes them, which is their call to make and reversible either way.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Owns one small JSON file and one pure selection rule. No knowledge of activation, installation, or
 * tools — `seed-bundled.ts` is the only writer, and the read side is two call sites that already
 * hold both a workspace root and a list of installed packages.
