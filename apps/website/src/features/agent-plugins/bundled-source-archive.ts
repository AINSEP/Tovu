/**
 * @file Turns a bundled Agent Plugin's SOURCE DIRECTORY (tracked in this repo, shipped in the
 * product) into the `{ archive: Uint8Array, expectedSha256, archiveReader }` triple
 * `installAgentPlugin` requires — so a pre-placed package goes through the exact same install path
 * as one downloaded from a URL, rather than around it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why not just copy the directory
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Because `installAgentPlugin` is where every guarantee lives: lexical and symlink zip-slip
 * refusal, entry/file/total-byte caps, atomic staging-then-publish, `chmod 0o555` freezing,
 * content-addressed dedup, and the tenant-scoped `forWorkspace()` resolution that makes it
 * impossible to publish into another workspace's tree. A `cp -R` in a seeder would reimplement
 * none of them, and every one it skipped would be a guarantee that silently applies to
 * operator-installed plugins and not to the one Tovu ships itself.
 *
 * The obstacle is only that `installAgentPlugin` speaks archives, and a directory is not one.
 * {@link packAgentPluginDirectory} therefore serialises the directory into a tiny, deterministic
 * archive format, and {@link createBundledSourceArchiveReader} reads it back — a round trip, not a
 * bypass. `yauzl`/`yazl` were the obvious alternative and are wrong here: `yazl` is a
 * devDependency used only by dev tooling and test fixtures (`development/scripts/package-agent-plugin.ts`
 * says so in its own header, "must never be imported by production code"), and DEFLATE would make
 * the digest depend on a compressor's version rather than on the bytes.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The digest is a real content digest
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `installAgentPlugin` verifies `sha256(archive) === expectedSha256` before extracting anything, and
 * uses that digest as the content address. Because this format is byte-deterministic — sorted
 * paths, explicit lengths, no timestamps, no permissions, no compression — the digest is a genuine
 * function of the package's own file contents and names. Two builds of the same source tree produce
 * the same digest, which is what makes seeding idempotent (`install.ts`'s `alreadyPublished` fast
 * path) instead of re-extracting on every boot.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * One directory walk (the only I/O) plus a pure encoder/decoder pair. `seed-bundled.ts` composes it
 * with `installAgentPlugin`.
