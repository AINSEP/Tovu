 * per-plugin budgets); `connections`, `state`, `publicConfig` and (when the site binds form
 * delivery) `deliveryBindings` and `forms` are surface-only and come from the composition root, each already
 * scoped to the call's plugin, workspace and admin. Nothing here names a provider.

 * @param optional.formsFor - The permission-checked workspace form reader; Jini exposes it only
 *   to surfaces declaring `forms: ["list"]`.
 * @complexity O(1) per call; each port is built lazily by its factory.
