/**
 * @file Tovu's `deliveryBindings` port for plugin admin-surface handlers (Jini's
 * `AdminSurfaceDeliveryBindings`): a plugin's destination screen lists, saves and removes the
 * site's form-delivery bindings for the adapters THIS plugin contributes, so an admin no longer
 * copies a destination's config by hand.
 *
 * Why the host re-checks what Jini's session already checked: the session knows only the surface's
 * declared adapter and connection ids; only the host knows which adapters the calling plugin really
 * contributes (`tovu-form-destinations.json`) and which connections it declares in this workspace.
 * And the session's ownership check is a separate `list` before the `save`/`remove`, so ownership is
 * re-read here inside the write itself (another writer may have changed the setting in between).
 *
 * Bindings are written through the forms build's binding owner (`core.forms/deliveryBindings`, via
 * the settings chokepoint), with the signed-in admin as the caller: the same validation and the same
 * `settings.workspace.write` authorization every other writer gets. No second store. The plugin
 * sees its own connection id, never the stored connection ref, and names forms by slug (the only
 * form identity a destination ever receives: the frozen job carries `form.slug`); the stored binding
 * keeps the forms' row ids, which is what delivery planning matches.
