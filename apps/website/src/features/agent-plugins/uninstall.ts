/**
 * @file `uninstallAgentPlugin()` — permanently removes one workspace's installed Agent Plugin: its
 * on-disk package(s) under `packages/sha256/*` for this `pluginId`, then its activation record.
 * `previewAgentPluginUninstall()` runs the same refusals without removing anything.
 *
 * `features/plugin-runtime/uninstall.ts` already has this exact feature for the OTHER plugin family
 * (`.tovu-plugin` site/runtime plugins) — this is "the same feature, one family over", mirroring its
 * shape: the same `<Domain>NotFoundError`/`<Domain>NotUninstallableError` pair, thrown for the same
 * two reasons (unknown id; nothing an operator can actually remove). Two deliberate divergences from
 * that file, both because the underlying mechanics genuinely differ, not by oversight:
 *
 * 1. **No third `PluginEnabledError`-equivalent precondition.** Plugin-runtime refuses to uninstall a
 *    plugin that is enabled in ANY workspace, because its on-disk artifact is INSTANCE-WIDE — shared
 *    across every workspace via one `installDir` — so removing it while a DIFFERENT workspace still
 *    has it enabled would silently break that workspace's runtime. Agent Plugins have no such
 *    hazard: `layout.ts`'s own header (owner decision, tenant-grade isolation, 2026-08-12) states
 *    plainly that each workspace gets its own `ws/<workspaceId>/packages/sha256/` tree, and "Uninstall
 *    is `rm -rf ws/<workspaceId>/packages/sha256/<digest>/`, full stop" — there is no OTHER workspace
 *    for this operation to endanger. Whether the CALLING workspace has this plugin currently enabled
 *    is not gated on either: disabling first buys no safety here (unlike plugin-runtime, disabling
 *    would not protect anyone else's runtime), and gating on it would only add friction with no
 *    corresponding risk removed.
 *
 * 2. **Bundled is refused as UNINSTALLABLE, not as NOT-FOUND — and for a different reason than
 *    plugin-runtime's built-ins.** Plugin-runtime's `PluginNotUninstallableError` covers a `"built-in"`
 *    discovery record that was never written to `installDir` at all — there is nothing on disk to
 *    remove. A bundled Agent Plugin is NOT that case: `seed-bundled.ts` genuinely extracts it onto
 *    disk at boot, so it IS `listInstalledPlugins`-visible and this function's own "not found" check
 *    would pass. The refusal here is about PERMANENCE, not presence: `recordBundledAgentPluginIfAbsent`
 *    re-seeds both the package and its (absent-record-only) disabled activation entry on every boot
 *    (`activation.ts`'s header), so deleting the files now would appear to succeed and then silently
 *    reappear on the next restart — a worse outcome than refusing outright, because it would look like
 *    uninstall lied. `AgentPluginNotUninstallableError`'s message says this plainly and names the
 *    levers that DO work: `plugins_set_enabled` with family `agent-plugin` (the assistant's own tool
 *    since a1abe2bb, so the model can act on the refusal itself) or the Agent Plugins admin screen's
 *    switch. Either one turns a bundled plugin off, even though nothing can make Tovu stop shipping it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Preview, then uninstall — both run the refusals
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `agent_plugins_uninstall` asks a human before it removes anything. A refusal has to come back
 * BEFORE that dialog, or a human is asked to confirm something that cannot happen, so the tool calls
 * `previewAgentPluginUninstall()` first. The preview carries only what a dialog may show (id,
 * versions, digests) — never `packageRoot`, which is a host path. After the answer the tool calls
 * `uninstallAgentPlugin()`, which runs both refusals again against the disk as it is then: the
 * dialog can stay open for minutes.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Tombstone vs. delete on the activation record — DELETE, settled
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * See `activation.ts`'s `deleteAgentPluginActivation()` for the mechanism; the decision itself
 * belongs here, next to the only call site that makes it. A tombstone (leaving `enabled: false` on
 * disk after the bytes are gone) would invert `activation.ts`'s own stated rule — "absent means
 * active, because an operator's own install IS the consent" — the moment this same plugin id is ever
 * reinstalled: the fresh install would inherit a stale disabled flag about bytes that no longer exist,
 * which is a worse UX than starting over. Deleting the record makes a future reinstall of this id
 * begin exactly where a first-ever install begins.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this module resolves its own workspace layout, rather than accepting one
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Same SECURITY discipline `install.ts`'s `InstallAgentPluginRequired.layout` documents in full: this
 * takes the INSTANCE-level `AgentPluginLayout` plus one `workspaceId`, and calls
 * `layout.forWorkspace(workspaceId)` itself, exactly once per call, so the packages directory it scans
 * and the activation file it edits can never come from two different, hand-stitched sources that
 * quietly disagree about which workspace they belong to.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why removal isn't a plain `fs.rm(recursive)`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `install.ts`'s `freezeTree` chmods every published package directory to `0o555` (no write bit) —
 * that's what makes the package genuinely read-only after install. A plain recursive `rm` on a frozen
 * tree fails EACCES trying to unlink/rmdir inside it (the same fact `__tests__/fixtures/force-remove.ts`
 * exists to work around in tests). `removeFrozenPackageTree` below is that same "restore write
 * permission, then remove" logic as real production code — this is the first production caller that
 * ever needs to remove a package root that install-time freezing already made.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why removal stages first — and why it stages NEXT TO the package, not under `staging/`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Removing a multi-digest plugin is several irreversible `rm`s followed by one activation-record
 * write. Done directly, a failure anywhere after the first `rm` leaves an installation that is
 * half-deleted and an activation record describing bytes that no longer exist — recoverable by
 * nobody. So every package root is first `rename`d aside (cheap, atomic within one filesystem, and
 * reversible), the activation record is deleted, and only then are the renamed trees actually
 * removed. Any failure before that last step puts every renamed tree straight back.
 *
 * Renaming a frozen package root needs its write bit back FIRST. `install.ts`'s own publish comment
 * records the measured fact this depends on: on this filesystem renaming an already-`0o555`
 * directory fails EACCES — and, re-measured here, that holds even when the rename stays inside the
 * same parent, so there is no permission-free way to move a frozen tree. `stageForRemoval` therefore
 * restores the owner write bit on the package ROOT only (never its contents), renames, and — on any
 * failure, including a rollback — puts the exact original mode back, so a failed uninstall leaves a
 * tree that is still frozen. That briefly-writable window is the same "accidental same-process
 * write" surface `freezeTree`'s own header scopes itself to, not a security boundary.
 *
 * The staged name is a SIBLING inside the same `packages/sha256/` directory rather than
 * `<workspaceRoot>/staging/` (which install uses for its own transactions): same parent means the
 * rename is guaranteed to be within one filesystem, and therefore atomic, without depending on a
 * second directory existing. The names begin with a dot and carry a random suffix, so they can never
 * be mistaken for an installed digest (`resolve-agent-plugin-refs.ts` matches `^[a-f0-9]{64}$`) nor
 * collide with a concurrent uninstall. A crash between the rename and the final remove strands a
 * `.uninstalling-*` directory an operator can delete — strictly better than a half-deleted install.
