/**
 * @file `retireBundledAgentPlugins()` — removes bundled Agent Plugins Tovu no longer ships from a
 * workspace, and moves their users onto the plugin that absorbed them. Runs on every boot from
 * `seed-bundled.ts`, after seeding, and is a no-op once a workspace has been migrated.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a retirement step exists
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Deleting `content/agent-plugins/<id>/` stops the seeder installing a plugin, but it removes nothing
 * a workspace already has: the installed package stays under `packages/sha256/`, its activation
 * record stays in `activations.json`, and its digest stays in `bundled-digests.json`. An ENABLED
 * leftover keeps its skill in every prompt, now duplicating (and slowly contradicting) the successor
 * that carries the same content. And the operator cannot remove it: `uninstall.ts` refuses a
 * bundled plugin because it would be re-seeded, which is exactly what stops being true here. Owner
 * rule: the user never fixes anything by hand, so the boot does it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * What happens per retired id (idempotent)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. Nothing installed and no activation record: nothing to do (the second boot after a migration).
 *    A leftover ledger entry is still dropped.
 * 2. The retired plugin was ENABLED (explicitly, or by the "absent means active" default while its
 *    package is installed): the successor is switched on — unless an operator explicitly turned the
 *    successor off, which is left exactly as it is and reported in the outcome. No silent override.
 * 3. The retired plugin's package(s) and activation record are removed through `uninstall.ts`
 *    (`retiredBundled: true` skips only its bundled refusal). A record with no package left is
 *    deleted directly.
 * 4. The retired id is dropped from `bundled-digests.json`.
 *
 * A malformed or unreadable activation record for the retired id stops that id's retirement with a
 * `failed` outcome and changes nothing: whether the operator had it enabled cannot be established,
 * so neither enabling the successor nor deleting the record is safe. The next boot retries.
 *
 * Out of scope on purpose: nothing a retired plugin could own survives it. Agent Plugins have no
 * per-plugin settings store (a workspace's `data/<pluginId>` directory has no production writer),
 * and custom credentials (a saved `fly.io` token, say) belong to the workspace, not to a plugin.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Composition over `activation.ts`, `uninstall.ts`, and `bundled-digests.ts`. Never throws: every
 * failure is captured per id, exactly like `seed-bundled.ts`'s own outcomes, so one stuck retirement
 * cannot stop a workspace from booting.
