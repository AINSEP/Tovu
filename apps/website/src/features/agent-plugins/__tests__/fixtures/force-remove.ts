 * @file Test-only cleanup shared across every test file in this feature that installs a real

 * (`install.ts`'s `freezeTree`), so a plain recursive `rm` on the enclosing temp dir fails EACCES
 * trying to unlink/rmdir inside it — that failure is proof the freeze worked, not a bug. Restores
 * write permission everywhere under `root` first, then removes it. Extracted here after the same
 * helper was independently duplicated across three test files.
