 * @file Path-safety primitive shared by extraction (`install.ts`) and any future preview read.
 *
 * The Agent Plugins spec's own MUST is a filesystem-RESOLVED containment check, not a lexical one:
 * "the filesystem-resolved path MUST remain within the filesystem-resolved plugin root... clients
 * MUST reject package paths that resolve outside it" (agent-plugins.org spec v1.0.0). These tests
 * cover both the cheap lexical rejection (no filesystem call needed) and the realpath-based rejection
 * (a lexically clean path that is, or passes through, a symlink planted by a hostile archive).
