/**
 * @file X1-X3 — the cross-process half of the concurrency race `activation.ts`'s in-process chain
 * (`72dc4766`, `39e664ab`) never closed: two SEPARATE OS processes, not two async calls in one, both
 * writing one workspace's `activations.json` at once (t91 2026-09-16, plan
 * `agent-reports/2026-09-16-t91-plan-activations-lock.md` §5). Each test spawns real
 * `tsx`-run children against `../fixtures/activation-writer-child.ts` rather than mocking anything
 * cross-process, because the bug this closes IS the absence of any cross-process coordination.
 *
 * X1 is the RED that must fail at HEAD (before `exclusive-file-lock.ts` existed): B's small write
 * completes fully inside the window A is paused between its own read and its own rename, and A's
 * later rename silently erases B's disable the instant it lands.
