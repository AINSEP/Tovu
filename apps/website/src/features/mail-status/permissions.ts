 * - `mail.activity.read`: full recipient details of the send history (addresses, ids, message ids).
 *   The built-in `admin` role holds it, stated against the role so already-seeded workspaces gain
 *   it too (see `features/identity/builtin-role-grants.ts`). Without it, holders of the page's
 *   status permission see the same outcomes with masked recipients.
 * - `mail.suppressions.manage`: removing an address from the do-not-send list. Owner decision
 *   (2026-10-22): owner-only, so it is deliberately granted to NO built-in role; the owner holds it
 *   through the `*` wildcard. Removal is owner only; the grant alone is not enough.
