/**
 * @file Contracts for the static-site exporter's route enumeration step (2026-08-15).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `RouteManifestPort` is the ONE place that knows "what URLs does this workspace's public site
 * actually serve" — deliberately its own port rather than a hand-rolled list inside the exporter
 * engine, so a future incremental/scheduled exporter (or an admin "N routes will be exported"
 * preview) can depend on the interface without pulling in the HTTP-driving writer.
 *
 * `src/seo/sitemap.ts`'s `buildSitemap` is NOT this port and must never be mistaken for it: it
 * enumerates only published, indexable posts, silently omitting home, products, theme-owned static
 * pages, redirects, and 404 — an SEO index and a deployable manifest answer different questions
 * (`development/docs/deployment/deployment-constraints.md` §3).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Tier-2 library, mirroring `src/redirects`/`src/seo`'s own `ports.ts` + implementation-file split.
 * The concrete reader (`route-manifest.ts`) reuses the exact selection logic real routes use — never
 * re-derives it — so the manifest can never enumerate a route the live server would not actually
 * serve, or miss one it would. As of 2026-08-16 that reuse no longer runs through a `server/
 * routes/site` import: `resolveActiveThemeId`/`resolveActiveTheme` are feature-owned
 * (`#src/features/theme/index`), and `resolveStorefrontProducts` is reached via
 * `RouteDeps.resolveStorefrontProducts` injection rather than a direct import — see
 * `route-manifest.ts`'s own file header for why the two took different shapes.
 */

/**
 * What kind of thing a route is, for reporting only — the exporter's writer does not branch on
 * this to decide HOW to fetch a route (every non-redirect, non-404 entry is fetched identically);
 * it exists so a human-facing export report can say "12 posts, 3 pages, 8 theme pages, 4 products"
 * instead of an undifferentiated route count.
