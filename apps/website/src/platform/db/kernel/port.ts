/**
 * @file The storage kernel port: the ONE async way a repo reaches its database, on every driver.
 * Plan: `ADS-memory/.local-artifacts/plans/2026-09-28-storage-adapter-plan.md`; decision:
 * `ADS-memory/reports/architecture/ADR-066-kysely-query-layer.md`.
 *
 * A repo is ONE Kysely query body for every dialect. It never holds a raw handle, never runs
 * `BEGIN`, never calls a driver API. It asks the kernel:
 *
 * - {@link StorageKernel.run} — run statements on the right executor: the open transaction when the
 *   caller is inside {@link StorageKernel.transaction}, else the base handle.
 * - {@link StorageKernel.transaction} — one unit of work. A NESTED call joins the outer one (no
 *   savepoint), so a service composing two repos that each wrap themselves still commits or rolls
 *   back as one. Calling it from inside a `run()` body throws: that body holds the handle a
 *   transaction would wait for.
 * - {@link StorageKernel.lockKey} — the explicit concurrency strategy for "nothing else may
 *   interleave here" (read-then-write sequences such as a ledger append). A transaction alone does
 *   not give that on Postgres (READ COMMITTED); this does, on every dialect.
 * - {@link StorageKernel.query} — a portable Kysely `sql` statement returning rows. For dialect
 *   helpers, migrations and introspection (`dialect.ts`), not for repos.
 *
 * Three separate things describe a kernel (never inferred from each other, never cached per process):
 * the SQL {@link StorageDialect}, the connection {@link StorageTransport}, and its
 * {@link StorageCapabilities}. Asking for a capability the kernel lacks throws
 * {@link UnsupportedCapabilityError}; nothing silently downgrades (e.g. a transaction never becomes
 * "run the statements one by one").
 *
 * Drivers live in `drivers/` and are the only files allowed to touch a driver's own API (the
 * raw-SQLite guard enforces that).
