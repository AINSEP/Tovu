/**
 * @file `HttpResponse.bodyBytes`/`bodyTruncated` — the byte-capable half of the guarded client,
 * added 2026-09-06 so `features/media-import` can fetch an image WITHOUT reaching past the ADR-038
 * SSRF guard to a raw `fetch`.
 *
 * The whole justification for the field is a contrast, so this file asserts the contrast directly
 * rather than only the happy half: for one and the same response body — a byte sequence that is
 * deliberately INVALID UTF-8 — `bodyBytes` comes back identical to what the transport produced,
 * while `bodyText` comes back mangled into U+FFFD replacement characters and is not recoverable.
 * A test that only checked "bodyBytes is defined" would pass just as happily against an
 * implementation that derived it from `bodyText`, which is precisely the bug worth preventing.
 *
 * An IP-literal target is used throughout (`8.8.8.8`, classified `public`) so no test here depends
 * on DNS: `client.ts`'s `resolveHostAddresses` short-circuits a literal address without a lookup.
