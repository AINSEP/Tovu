/**
 * @file The one HTML/XML text escaper. A leaf module with NO imports, on purpose: the old copies
 * lived inside `render.ts`, `form-render.ts` and `static-render.ts` and were duplicated rather than
 * shared because importing them would have closed a runtime import cycle. A module that imports
 * nothing can be imported from anywhere.
 *
 * `&` is replaced first: it is the escape character for every entity after it, so replacing any
 * other character first would double-escape the `&` that replacement introduced. The apostrophe
 * becomes the numeric `&#39;` in HTML, because `&apos;` is undefined in HTML4/XHTML1.
