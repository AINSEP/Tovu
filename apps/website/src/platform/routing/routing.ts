/**
 * @file Resolution logic for the Tovu `routing` Tier-2 library (ADR-039 v0).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Implements the inverse resolver (`urlFor`/`isActive`) Menus (ADR-029) and
 * SEO (ADR-032) consume, the forward resolution pipeline registration seam
 * Redirects (ADR-033) will consume, the named-route registry backing `route`
 * targets, and the `SlugChangeCapture` registration slot (ADR-039 §4).
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - `routing/types.ts` supplies the `RouteTarget` vocabulary and result shapes.
 * - `routing/ports.ts` supplies `RouteResolverDeps` (reuses `PostRepoPort`).
 * - Only `post` is a real implemented content type today, so `entryRef`
 *   resolution goes through `PostRepoPort` directly; `termRef` is a documented
 *   stub (taxonomy doesn't exist yet — ADR-029 Round-3 fold item 1).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Core-owned Tier-2 library code. No Drizzle/SQLite adapter and no HTTP
 * wiring live here (that is out of scope for this v0 build) — this file is
 * pure resolution logic over injected ports and in-module registries.
