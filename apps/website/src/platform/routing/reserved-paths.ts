/**
 * @file The ONE rule for "does this site path belong to the admin application rather than to the
 * public site".
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The site app and the admin application share a single Express app —
 * `admin-static.ts` mounts the admin SPA at `app.use("/admin", ...)` and `core.ts` mounts the
 * session gate at `app.use("/api/admin", ...)`, alongside `/api/runs`, `/api/tools` and friends.
 * So a "site path" a caller hands to a public-site feature can silently name the authenticated
 * surface instead. Several features need to refuse that, and each one refusing it slightly
 * differently is how a bypass gets built: `site-inspection`'s `published_page_fetch` (which claims
 * to fetch a PUBLISHED PAGE) and `redirects` (its write chokepoint, which stores a `Location`
 * target, and its read gate, which checks the interpolated `Location` a visitor's browser receives)
 * are the live consumers today.
 *
 * Why the rule is not `path.startsWith("/admin")`:
 * - `/administer-survey` is ordinary site content and must keep working, so the comparison is per
 *   SEGMENT, not per prefix.
 * - `/%61dmin` is compared AFTER one percent-decode, not on the raw bytes. Express (which routes on
 *   the raw path) and browsers (which do not decode `%61` in a path) do NOT treat it as `/admin`; a
 *   proxy or server that decodes before routing does. Refusing it is deliberate over-refusal — the
 *   safe direction for a rule whose job is to keep public redirects and fetches off the admin
 *   surface.
 * - `/ADMIN` reaches the same Express mount (Express matches paths case-insensitively by default),
 *   so the comparison is case-folded.
 * - `/blog/../admin` is `/admin` by the time a browser issues the request, so dot segments are
 *   resolved first.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Platform library, no I/O. `routing` already owns the shared URL vocabulary Menus/SEO/Redirects
 * were deliberately stopped from each reinventing (see this directory's INFO.md), which is the same
 * reason this rule lives here rather than inside either consumer.

 * delimiter and TRUNCATE the path — turning `/x#/../admin` into `/x` and losing the very segment
 * this check exists to find. A browser does no such thing: it never decodes `%23` before splitting
 * the path, so the truncation would be a false negative, not a match for real behavior.
 *
 * Empty segments are dropped, so `//admin` collapses to `/admin`. That is deliberately stricter
 * than a URL parser (which preserves `//`); over-matching here only ever refuses more.
 *
 * @param path - A decoded path, expected to start with `/`.

 * reaches this. Do not export this directly.
 *
 * Order is load-bearing: decode ONCE, then resolve dot segments, then compare the first segment
 * case-folded. Decoding first is what catches `/%61dmin` (over-refusal for Express and browsers, a

/**
 * Classify an already-parsed URL's pathname against the admin application's URL space.
 *
 * Takes the {@link URL} itself, not a bare pathname string, so this cannot be handed a raw,

 * and this rule's whole design (see the module doc) depends on comparing the DECODED, dot-resolved
 * form a URL parser would actually produce. A caller that only has a raw string — a stored redirect
 * target, anything from user input — must go through {@link checkSiteRelativeTarget} instead, which
 * parses it (and rejects what doesn't parse) before this check ever runs.
 *
 * PRECONDITION: the caller has already established that `url` is on the site's own origin. This
 * function reads only `pathname`, so `new URL("//admin", base)` (host `admin`, pathname `/`)
 * returns `ok`. It deliberately does not compare origins itself: `platform/routing` cannot use
 * `features/origin`'s normalizer, and a string `URL.origin` comparison is wrong for redirect
 * candidates (`https://site./admin`). Callers: `checkSiteRelativeTarget` (probe-origin check),
