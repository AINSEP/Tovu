/**
 * @file The phase registry's LIFECYCLE contract (2026-09-16) — the half `routing.test.ts` and
 * `routing.phase-runners.test.ts` never covered, because both only ever ask what a registered
 * handler resolves to, never what happens to a handler whose registrant is gone.
 *
 * `phaseRegistry` is module-level and so process-wide, but its registrants are not: a composition
 * root registers a handler that has closed over THAT composition's resources, and a process can run
 * more than one composition (an integration test composes one per site it boots; loading
 * `composition/app.ts` itself registers nothing — see t91 F4.1). Append-only, every superseded
 * composition's closure stayed on the live request path forever. The concrete production-shaped
 * failure that produced these tests: a site's `SqliteRedirectRepo` handler outliving that site's
 * database, so a later request threw `TypeError: The database connection is not open` out of the
 * phase and 500ed `/` and `/pricing` — while `/products`, which runs no phase at all, kept serving
 * and made it look like a render bug.
 *
 * Two independent guarantees are pinned here, deliberately not one:
 *   1. OWNERSHIP — an owned registration supersedes that owner's previous one, and can be revoked
 *      outright, so the stale handler is not merely harmless but absent.
 *   2. ISOLATION is opt-in (`onError: "skip"`); the default propagates. A `"skip"` handler that
 *      throws is skipped, not propagated, so ONE registrant's fault can never take down an unrelated
 *      route — but only for a registrant that opted in, because it knows its own failure can only
 *      DECLINE an outcome. A handler with no `onError` (or an explicit `"fail"`) rethrows instead, so
 *      the caller's own error handling runs — see t91 F4.3, and
 *      `site-phase-handler-fail-policy.test.ts` for the route-level 500 that default produces.
