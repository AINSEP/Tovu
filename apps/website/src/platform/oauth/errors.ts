/**
 * @file The structured error taxonomy for `src/platform/oauth/`.
 *
 * The load-bearing field is {@link OAuthError.retryable}, and it is `false` for all but two codes.
 * Callers keep the error-code vocabulary exhaustive: adding a code is a deliberate
 * contract change. `retryAfterSeconds` is the device-poll interval in seconds.
 * That retry asymmetry is the whole point of this file:
 *
 * - An authorization-code exchange is NOT safely repeatable. The `code` is single-use and the first
 *   response may have been lost *after* the provider already redeemed it, so a blind retry can
 *   burn a code that actually succeeded and leave the operator staring at a failure for a
 *   connection that exists. Every code-exchange failure is therefore terminal here, and the retry
 *   decision is handed back to the human, who can re-authorize with one click.
 * - Device-grant polling is the one place where retrying is not just safe but REQUIRED by the spec
 *   (RFC 8628 §3.5): `authorization_pending` and `slow_down` mean "keep polling". Those two, and
 *   only those two, carry `retryable: true`.
 *
 * The second load-bearing field is {@link OAuthError.operatorAction}. These errors reach two
 * audiences that cannot act on the same text: an admin looking at a form, and a language model
 * deciding whether to call a tool again. `operatorAction` is the sentence written for the human;
 * `message` is what a model sees, and for the terminal codes it says *do not retry* in words,
 * because a model that reads "authorization expired" without that instruction will loop.
 * Unrecognized provider error codes are terminal `OAUTH_PROVIDER_REJECTED`: an unknown
 * error is not evidence that retrying a non-idempotent exchange is safe.
 *
 * Provider response bodies are NEVER carried in `message`. A token endpoint's error body can echo
 * request detail, and these strings reach a browser and a model. The provider's own RFC 6749 §5.2
 * error *code* is kept in {@link OAuthError.providerErrorCode} for logs, because that field is a
 * closed vocabulary rather than free text.
