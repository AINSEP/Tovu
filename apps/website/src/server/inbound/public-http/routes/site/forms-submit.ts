/**
 * @file Public submission route for `forms` (SPEC-010 `FORMS_POST_SUBMIT`, REQ-05).
 *
 * Mirrors `routes/site/analytics-ingest.ts`'s public-route shape: no session required, registered
 * before the site `/:slug` catch-all (see `server/app.ts`'s wiring). Reuses `resolveClientIp`
 * (`core/rate-limit/rate-limit.ts`) rather than re-deriving IP resolution — all real validation
 * happens inside `submitForm` (C-008); this file owns only the HTTP boundary.
 *
 * A native `<form>` POST navigates the browser to whatever this route returns — the ORIGINAL bug
 * here (2026-08-31 fix) was that every branch replied with raw JSON, which a JS-disabled visitor saw
 * as a literal `{"status":"accepted"}` screen instead of their page. `wantsHtmlResponse` splits the
 * two audiences this endpoint actually has by content negotiation: a fetch/XHR/API caller (this
 * file's own existing tests, none of which set an `Accept` header, land here) keeps the untouched
 * JSON contract; a real browser form submission (`Accept: text/html,...`) gets a Post/Redirect/Get
 * 303 back to the page that hosted the form, with the outcome threaded through the query string via
 * {@link encodeFormSubmissionResultQuery} — `routes/site/pages.ts` decodes and splices it back into
 * that page (`http/site/render.ts`'s `injectFormSubmissionResultIntoHtml`) on the way back down.
 *
 * A validation failure ALSO sets the `tovu_form_flash` cookie ({@link setFormFlashCookieForValidationFailure})
 * so the OTHER fields the visitor already typed survive that same round trip instead of coming back
 * wiped (2026-08-31 fix) — see `http/site/form-render.ts`'s "Validation flash cookie" section for why
 * this travels via a cookie rather than the query string.
