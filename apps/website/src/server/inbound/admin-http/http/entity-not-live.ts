 * @file S4 (web-high fix plan, 2026-09-24) — the HTTP half of the generic entity-liveness guard.
 * Every admin-http route this plan touches (pages, SEO, redirects, media, content-types, taxonomy)
 * puts a call to {@link entityNotLiveResponse} first in its existing error ladder, so a writer's
 * `assertEntityLive` refusal (`@jini-ai/cms/core`) reaches the client as 409 `ENTITY_IN_TRASH` /
 * `ENTITY_TOMBSTONED` instead of falling through to a generic 500. Mirrors the `{status, body} |
 * null` shape `seoPutEntryErrorResponse` and friends already use, rather than writing to `res`
 * directly, so a route can call it first and fall through to its own remaining branches unchanged.
