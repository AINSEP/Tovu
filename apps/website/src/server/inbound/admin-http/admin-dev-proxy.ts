/**
 * @file Proxies `/admin/*` to the admin Vite dev server (`TOVU_ADMIN_DEV_PROXY_URL`) so the browser
 * never leaves this server's own origin — replacing the 302-redirect dev-proxy mode `admin-static.ts`
 * used to run.
 *
 * The redirect existed because a straight proxy has one hard problem: Vite's HMR client opens a
 * WebSocket, and an ordinary HTTP reverse proxy only ever sees `request` events, not the `upgrade`
 * event a WebSocket handshake arrives as. A redirect sidestepped that by putting the browser
 * directly on Vite's own origin, where its WS client needs no help. This module solves the problem
 * instead of avoiding it: {@link createAdminDevProxyRequestHandler} forwards ordinary requests, and
 * {@link registerAdminDevProxyUpgrade} forwards the `upgrade` event so HMR keeps working through a
 * same-origin proxy. Verified against the installed Vite (7.3.6) source: with no `server.hmr.path`
 * override, its HMR client computes the socket URL as `<page origin><config.base>` — i.e. exactly
 * `/admin/` on whichever origin served the page — and its server-side `shouldHandle` gate matches
 * upgrades by that same base path, so proxying `/admin/*` (including the bare-path fix below) is
 * sufficient; no separate HMR-specific route is needed.

/**
 * A TLS agent scoped to ONE dev-only upstream: Vite's own mkcert-issued certificate is

 * this module's own outbound connections only; `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` is never touched, so
 * every other TLS connection this process makes (including real calls to third-party provider APIs)
 * keeps full certificate verification. `keepAlive` reuses one TLS connection across the many small
 * ESM module requests a Vite dev page issues, rather than a fresh handshake per file.
