/**
 * @file The single chokepoint deciding WHICH key a BYOK probe sends and WHERE it sends it, shared by
 * `test-connection.ts` and `list-models.ts`.
 *
 * ## Two stored credentials, two opt-ins
 *
 * There are exactly three keys a probe can carry, and this module is where that choice is made:
 * the one typed into the request body, the workspace's SITE credential (`useStoredCredential`), and
 * the calling admin's OWN execution credential (`useAdminStoredCredential`). The last two are
 * separate flags on purpose and must never be merged into one "use whatever is stored": they are
 * different secrets belonging to different subjects, and the screens that probe them are different
 * screens. Collapsing them would let the AI Assistant tab silently probe the admin's personal key,
 * or Settings → Execution mode silently probe the visitor's — the exact confusion ADR-058 §5 makes
 * structural.
 *
 * ## The boundary this exists to hold
 *
 * ADR-058 makes the SITE credential write-only: `get-site-credential.ts` returns `isSet` + `masked`
 * and never the key, so not even an `admin.assistant.manage` holder can read back a key someone else
 * saved. Both probe routes then take `useStoredCredential: true`, decrypt that key server-side, and
 * make one outbound call with it.
 *
 * Those two facts are only compatible if the CALLER cannot choose the destination. Before this
 * module they could: `baseUrl` came from the request body, so a single authenticated request could
 * name any host and have the server deliver the decrypted key to it — turning a write-only secret
 * into a readable one, silently, with nothing persisted and nothing to notice afterwards.
 *
 * The SSRF guard in `@jini-ai/agent-runtime`'s `connection-guard.ts` does not close this and was
 * never meant to. It blocks loopback/RFC1918/link-local/CGNAT/multicast — *internal* address space,
 * to stop a caller pivoting into the server's own network. A public host an attacker controls is
 * exactly what it is designed to let through, because that is what every real provider is.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A key the caller supplied goes wherever the caller says. It is their secret, typed into their own
 * form; sending it to a host they named is the operation they asked for, and `AiAssistant.tsx`'s
 * `runKeyTest` documents that consent explicitly.
 *
 * A key the caller CANNOT read goes only where the server already recorded it belongs. The stored
 * row carries its own `baseUrl` (`site-credential-store.ts`'s `ResolvedSiteAssistantCredential`);
 * that value, not the request body's, is what reaches the wire. The distinction is consent: an
 * operator can consent with their own credential and cannot consent with one they have never seen.
 *
 * ## Why a mismatch is a 400 rather than a silent substitution
 *
 * Both are equally safe — either way the caller's string never reaches the network. Rejecting is
 * chosen because substituting would make the probe answer a question nobody asked: an operator who
 * switched the endpoint field to Anthropic and pressed "Test connection" would get a green result
 * measured against the stored Google endpoint, and reasonably read it as "Anthropic works". A 400
 * naming both endpoints is the honest answer, and it is also the correct one on the merits — a key
 * issued for one provider cannot meaningfully be probed against another. Type a key for the new
 * endpoint, or save the endpoint first.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does NOT close
 *
 * `put-site-credential.ts` lets the same `admin.assistant.manage` principal write `baseUrl`. Such a
 * principal can therefore still point the stored credential at a host they control and have the key
 * delivered there. That path is not silent the way this one was: it persists, `get-site-credential`
 * reports it back, it shows in the admin UI, and it breaks the live visitor assistant
 * (`server/modules/site-assistant.ts` uses the same stored endpoint) — so it is self-revealing where
 * a body parameter left no trace at all. Closing it properly means constraining which endpoints may
 * be STORED, which is an allow-list and a product decision: `connection-guard.ts` deliberately
 * permits loopback for local Ollama, and real deployments point at custom gateways. That belongs in
 * the credential-write route with an explicit policy, not smuggled in here.
 */

/** Mirrors `connection-guard.ts`'s own `validateBaseUrl` normalization (`trim()` then strip trailing
 *  slashes) so this comparison agrees with the string the guard would actually parse — a stored
 *  `"https://x/"` and a requested `"https://x"` are the same endpoint and must not read as a
 *  mismatch. Deliberately does NOT lowercase: a URL's host is case-insensitive but its path is not,
 *  and folding case here would let `/V1` and `/v1` compare equal. */
