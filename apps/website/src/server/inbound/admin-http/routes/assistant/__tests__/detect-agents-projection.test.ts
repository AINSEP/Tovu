/**
 * @file `toExecutionTabAgent` is the projection from `@jini-ai/agent-runtime`'s `DetectedAgent`
 * onto `@jini-ai/ui`'s. It is a hand-written field list, which is exactly the shape that drifts:
 * detection pays to discover a field, the projection forgets to carry it, and the card renders
 * nothing with no error anywhere.
 *
 * That had already happened to both reasoning-effort fields. `LocalCliAgentCard` has rendered a
 * "Reasoning effort" control for any agent reporting `reasoningOptions` since it was ported, and
 * `claude`/`codex` have declared those options for just as long — but this function dropped them,
 * so the control was unreachable in Tovu for every runtime. These tests pin both fields to the
 * projection so a future narrowing fails here instead of silently in the UI.
 *
 * Exported for this test the same way `resolveTestAgentOutcome` was extracted for its own (see
 * that file's header): the route itself needs a real PATH scan and a real DB, neither of which a
 * field-projection assertion should have to stand up.
