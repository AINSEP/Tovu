// Self-signed localhost fixture; used only by hermetic dev-proxy tests.
// Generated per test process rather than committed: the secret-scan guard
// (features/webhooks/__tests__/secret-scan-guard.test.ts) forbids private-key blocks in tracked
// files, throwaway test keys included. node:crypto cannot issue an X.509 certificate, so this uses
// `openssl req` the same way development/scripts/__tests__/dev-desktop.test.mjs does. The proxy's
// dev upstream agent skips verification (`rejectUnauthorized: false`), so the certificate's
// identity does not matter, only that the upstream speaks real TLS.
