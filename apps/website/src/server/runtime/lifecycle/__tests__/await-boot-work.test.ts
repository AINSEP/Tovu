/**
 * @file A store close must not land under boot work the composition started and never awaited
 * (`legacyPublishCredentialsReady`, `createApp`'s BYOK tool-registration pass), or those passes log
 * "The database connection is not open". The wait is bounded so a hung pass cannot hang shutdown.
 *
 * Outcome Matrix:
 *   Given no boot work                         -> resolves at once, nothing logged
 *   Given two pending passes                   -> resolves only after BOTH settle
 *   Given a pass that rejects                  -> still resolves (the close must run), nothing logged
 *   Given a pass that never settles            -> resolves after the bound, logged
