 *
 * ## Why this table needs TWO builders, unlike every sibling
 *
 * `external_mcp_servers` carries **two independent sealed blobs on the same row**:
 *
 * - `sealed_*` — the static env block (`{NAME: value}`) handed to a stdio child process.
 * - `oauth_sealed_*` — `{ clientSecret?, tokens? }` for an OAuth-authorized connection.
 *
 * They are different secret classes with different lifecycles: an env block is operator-entered and
 * changes when the operator edits it, while the OAuth blob is rotated by a refresh flow. Sealing
 * both under one AAD would make them interchangeable *within a row* — an attacker able to move
 * column values could present the env blob in the OAuth slot and vice versa. The distinct
 * `external-mcp-env:` / `external-mcp-oauth:` prefixes are domain separation, and they are why this
 * table also carries two independent version discriminators rather than one.
 *
 * Format: `external-mcp-{env,oauth}:v1:${workspaceId}:${serverId}`. This table has no surrogate
 * `id` column — `(workspace_id, server_id)` IS the primary key (`db/schema.sqlite.ts`'s
 * `externalMcpServers`) — so the AAD binds that composite PK directly. A ciphertext sealed for one
 * server fails auth-tag verification if presented as any other server's, in the same workspace or
 * any other.
 *
 * Legacy no-AAD blobs remain readable through `aad_version`/`oauth_aad_version`; see the schema
 * contract and `development/scripts/backfill-external-mcp-aad.ts`. The discriminators must retain
 * each blob's sealing mode.
