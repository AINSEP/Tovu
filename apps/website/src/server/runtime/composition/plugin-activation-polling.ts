 * P0b's original failure was two composePluginRuntime registries: an admin enable/disable updated
 * only its own registry, while the daemon kept its boot snapshot. Boot readiness fixed initial
 * staleness, not later changes. Polling durable activation row versions was chosen because sharing
 * content.db did not share either bus or hook registry; an enqueue-only daemon could not consume
 * an outbox notification safely. ADR-070 removes that daemon registry, while the serving process
 * retains this reconciliation against changes from another process. Never remove the server's
