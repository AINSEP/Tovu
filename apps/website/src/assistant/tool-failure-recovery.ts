/**
 * @file The CONSUMER of `contracts/core/tool-failure-diagnostics.ts`'s `ToolFailureDiagnostic`
 * contract — the generic ask -> apply -> retry-once loop that contract's own header describes as the
 * payoff for adopting it ("one generic loop ... can handle a failure mode nobody wrote code for, using
 * the identical mechanism that already handles one somebody did"). Before this file, `hint`/
 * `remedyToolId` were read by nobody but the MODEL, acting on prose in a tool's own catalog
 * description (`custom_credential_verify`/`custom_credential_make_request`'s "ask the human ...
 * retry ONCE" wording). This file makes the same recovery a real mechanism that runs whether or not
 * the model happens to follow that prose.
 *
 * ## The seam: a `ToolExecutor` decorator, not a tool
 *
 * `withToolFailureRecovery` wraps `@jini-ai/daemon`'s `ToolExecutor` — the SAME kind of drop-in
 * `tool-executor-audit.ts`'s `withToolAttemptAudit` already is, for the same reason: this is the one
 * layer that (a) sees every completed tool result BEFORE it reaches the model, (b) is handed the
 * live `emitSurface` a handler would use to raise a human-facing surface, and (c) can re-invoke a
 * tool — the remedy, then the original again — with the SAME `principal`/`run`/`signal` the first
 * call had. No domain module (a `tool-registrations.ts`) has all three: a domain handler sees only
 * its OWN result, not another domain's `remedyToolId`. The tool-registration layer was considered and
 * rejected for exactly that reason — `custom_credential_set_username` is a different domain from
 * whatever OTHER tool a future diagnostic might name, and this loop has to work for a diagnostic
 * nobody has written yet, not just this one.
 *
 * Composed OUTSIDE `withToolAttemptAudit` in `agent-daemon-server.ts` (audit wraps the bare executor;
 * this wraps the audited one) so the remedy call and the retry are each their own audited attempt,
 * not lost inside one outer "completed" row — see that file's own wiring comment.
 *
 * ## What triggers it
 *
 * Only a `status: 'completed'` execution (a handler that returned normally) is even inspected — a
 * thrown error has no structured output to carry a diagnostic in, and `ToolFailureDiagnostic` was
 * never meant to model that case (see that file's own header, facet 1). The completed output is
 * walked (bounded, see {@link findActionableDiagnostic}) for the first plain object carrying BOTH a
 * string `hint` AND a string `remedyToolId`. `hint` with no `remedyToolId` is deliberately NOT
 * actionable here — the general contract's own header says as much ("no registered tool can supply
 * the fix yet ... still worth surfacing to a human who can act on it by hand"): a human reading the
 * model's own report of the failure is that "by hand" path; this loop only exists for the case where
 * a tool id names something IT can do about it.
 *
 * ## What it asks for, and why that can never be a secret
 *
 * The loop does not know what a `hint` means — it is prose. What it CAN know, structurally, is the
 * remedy tool's own published {@link ToolDescriptor.inputSchema}: which fields it requires, and which
 * of those the ORIGINAL failing call's input already supplies (by matching key name — e.g. both
 * `custom_credential_make_request` and `custom_credential_set_username` name a `label`). Whatever is
 * required but not already known is the ONE thing worth asking a human for — see
 * {@link planRemedyCall}. This is deliberately narrow: more than one unknown field, or a field whose
 * schema type isn't plain text, means this loop has no safe, generic way to ask for it, and it backs
 * off entirely rather than invent a shape.
 *
 * That narrowness is what keeps a secret out of this loop's own text field, BY CONSTRUCTION, not by a
 * rule someone has to remember: `custom_credential_set_token`'s entire schema is `{label}`, and
 * `label` is already known from the original call — so `planRemedyCall` computes ZERO fields to ask
 * for, and this loop calls it with nothing but the carried-forward `label`. The token itself, if that
 * tool is ever named as a `remedyToolId`, would still only ever reach the server the way that tool's
 * OWN handler already collects it (its own masked form, opened when THIS loop invokes it) — never
 * through a field this loop rendered, and never through a model-issued call's params. See
 * `credentialed-request.ts`'s header for the incident this reasoning was written against.
 *
 * ## The one-cycle guard — structural, not a counter
 *
 * `execute` below calls `inner.execute` up to three times (the original call, the remedy call, the
 * retry) and NEVER calls itself or the wrapper it returns. There is therefore no code path by which a
 * hint surfacing on the remedy call's own result, or on the retry's result, can trigger a second ask
 * -> apply -> retry cycle: the scan-for-a-diagnostic step only ever runs once per external
 * `execute()` invocation, because it is written exactly once, outside any loop or recursion. A future
 * edit would have to ADD a call from inside this function back into itself to reintroduce a second
 * cycle — it cannot happen by a counter being reset, a flag being missed, or any other stateful
 * mistake, because no state is involved at all.
 *
 * ## What it never does
 *
 * - Never suppresses the original failure: every early return hands back `result` — the exact object
 *   `inner.execute` produced for the original call, provider body and status included — untouched.
 *   The one return that is not byte-identical still carries that exact `output`: a remedy refused
 *   because this execution is read-only-constrained adds an `error` explaining that the recovery was
 *   not attempted (see `read-only-tool-constraint.ts`), because returning the original silently would
 *   be its own lie — "nothing was written" and "nothing was ever going to be tried" are different
 *   facts, and the caller can only act on the second one if it is told.
 * - Never runs a remedy that writes on behalf of a caller that asked for reads only. The dispatch
 *   below would be refused by `withReadOnlyToolConstraint` in any case — that gate is the
 *   enforcement, and it sits innermost precisely so it does not depend on this file remembering —
 *   but this loop asks the same single question first so no human is ever prompted for an answer
 *   that would then be thrown away.
 * - Never invents an answer: a declined, dismissed, expired, or blank response to the recovery surface
 *   is treated as "do not proceed," not as licence to guess.
 * - Never adds cost to the overwhelmingly common no-hint case: the scan is one bounded, pure walk of
 *   an already-in-memory value, no I/O, no surface, no second call.
 *
 * Architectural role: `src/assistant` composition-layer adapter, mirroring `tool-executor-audit.ts`'s
 * own role — depends on the domain-agnostic surface-exchange contract and the kernel's own
 * `ToolExecutor`/`ToolRegistry` shapes, never on any domain feature.
