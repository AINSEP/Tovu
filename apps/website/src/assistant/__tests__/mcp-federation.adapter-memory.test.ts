 * @file Direct tests for the federation test doubles themselves (`adapter.memory.ts`), not through
 * a consumer. Every existing caller (`mcp-federation.registrations.test.ts`,
 * `mcp-federation.stdio-adapter.test.ts`) always supplies its own `onCall`/scripts every scenario
 * it needs, so a handful of the doubles' own documented fallback/guard behaviors were never
 * exercised by any of them — this file exists to close exactly those, independent of any specific
 * consumer's usage pattern (the right way to test a fixture: prove the fixture behaves as
 * documented, not just that some consumer happens to work).
