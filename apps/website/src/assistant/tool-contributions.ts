 * for `post`/`page`, the same permission `content_post_create`/`content_post_update` already
 * declare), never a single flat permission shared by the whole generic tool. This is what makes
 * "a caller permitted for posts but not media cannot copy media through it" true by construction: a
 * caller lacking THIS resource's permission is refused before `duplicate` is ever called, regardless
 * of what any other resource's permission is.
 *
 * `duplicate` still owns whatever FINER-grained authorization/guard logic the resource's real
 * write-service already applies (e.g. `post`'s own upfront `content.read` check before it will even
 * disclose the source row exists) — this registry's `permission` is the generic tool's own outer
 * gate, not a replacement for a resource's existing internal ones.
