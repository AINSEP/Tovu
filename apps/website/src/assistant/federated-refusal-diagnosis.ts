/**
 * @file The CALL-TIME half of "a refusal must never be silent" — `mcp-federation/refusal-notice.ts`
 * is the BOOT-TIME half (the prompt prefix every run starts with). Read that file's header first;
 * this one only makes sense as the second half of the same incident.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The defect this closes
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A federated tool this boot refused is never registered (`mcp-federation/trust.ts`'s
 * `admitRemoteTools`), so `@jini-ai/daemon`'s `createToolExecutor` does the only thing its contract
 * allows for an id it does not know: it THROWS `ToolExecutor: unknown tool "<id>"` — "a
 * routing/programming error", per that file's own doc, never a `ToolExecutionResult`. That throw
 * propagates through every decorator in `tool-executor-stack.ts` (each of which passes it through
 * unchanged) and out through `@jini-ai/http-kit`'s `delegated-tools.ts`, whose route wraps the whole
 * call in a try/catch that treats ANY throw as SEC-005-worthy: it redacts the message to a bare
 * `INTERNAL_ERROR` + correlation id and sends the real text ONLY to `onInternalError` (the daemon's
 * `console.error`). The model — and therefore the user — sees an opaque 500 indistinguishable from a
 * genuine internal fault, for a call that was in fact refused for a nameable, fixable reason.
 *
 * `mcp-federation/refusal-notice.ts` already solves the ENUMERATION half of this (the boot prompt
 * names every actionable refusal up front) but deliberately never mentions `not-in-operator-allowlist`
 * (its R-B: reporting every tool an operator never asked for would spam the prompt on a real server
 * with dozens of unwanted tools). That silence is correct for a list nobody asked to see. It is not
 * correct for a call the model actually attempted — the model has, by naming this exact tool id,
 * already decided it wants it, so telling it why the call failed is never noise. See
 * `refusal-notice.ts`'s `explainFederatedToolRefusal` for the one explanation R-B withholds from the
 * boot prefix but this file needs for an attempt.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why a decorator, and why OUTERMOST
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `ToolExecutor` is a plain structural interface and every one of Tovu's existing decorators
 * (`read-only-tool-constraint.ts`, `tool-executor-audit.ts`, `tool-failure-recovery.ts`,
 * `tool-executor-stack.ts`) is exactly this shape — a wrapper, not an upstream change. This one is
 * composed OUTSIDE all three of those (see `agent-daemon-server.ts`'s `toolExecutor` construction),
 * not folded into `tool-executor-stack.ts` itself: every existing decorator still sees and classifies
 * the ORIGINAL throw exactly as it does today — `tool-executor-audit.ts`'s `isUnknownToolError` still
 * records an `unknown-tool` audit row, byte-for-byte the current behavior — and this layer only ever
 * intercepts what is ABOUT TO ESCAPE the whole stack, converting it into a legible result at the very
 * last moment instead of an opaque throw. Composed here rather than baked into
 * `createAssistantToolExecutor` for the same reason `tool-executor-stack.ts` stays free of federation
 * concerns: BYOK shares that stack and has no federated connections or admission snapshot to check
 * against.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the result is `status: 'failed', errorKind: 'validation'`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Not a new status, and not `'denied'`: `@jini-ai/http-kit`'s `delegated-tools.ts` already maps
 * `'failed'` with `errorKind === 'validation'` to a real, UN-redacted `400 BAD_REQUEST` carrying the
 * handler's own message verbatim — the exact "reason reaches the model" property this file exists
 * for, already wired, with zero changes to any Jini package. `'denied'` was considered and rejected:
 * `toolExecutionResultToApiResult` maps it to a FIXED string ("this operation was denied by policy")
 * and ignores `ToolExecutionResult.error` entirely, so a custom message placed there would never reach
 * the wire. `'validation'` is a deliberate reuse of a status that normally means "the caller's input
 * was malformed" for a case that is really "the caller's TARGET was refused" — accepted because it is
 * the only existing carrier for a free-text, non-redacted message, and because both share the same
 * caller-facing shape: a call the requester can fix by asking for something else, not a fault on this
 * side.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why its own minted result is redacted here, not left to `withRedactedToolFailures`
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This decorator is composed OUTERMOST (see above), so a `failed` result it mints itself in its own
 * `catch` block never passes back through `withRedactedToolFailures`, which sits INSIDE
 * `createAssistantToolExecutor` (`tool-executor-stack.ts`) — every other `failed`-result path in the
 * stack is redacted; this was the one that structurally could not be. Today `remoteName` is the only
 * upstream-influenced piece of the composed string (the external server's own advertised tool name,
 * sanitized by `safeRemoteName` against injection characters but not against secret shapes) and
 * `connectionId`/`explanation` are operator-authored or fixed prose, but calling
 * {@link redactSecretShapes} directly on the composed message — mirroring `tool-failure-redaction.ts`'s
 * own `errorKind: 'validation'` branch exactly — closes the hole structurally rather than relying on
 * that staying true.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `src/assistant` composition-layer adapter, matching its three siblings above. Depends on
 * `mcp-federation`'s pure reduction functions and on `contracts/core/secret-redaction.ts`'s pure
 * engine — no I/O, no registry, no protocol of its own.

 *   `agent-daemon-server.ts`'s `start()`), this decorator's behavior is byte-identical to before this
 *   parameter existed: every one of this file's own pre-2026-09-24 tests passes an unchanged 2-arg
 *   call and must keep throwing for a federated-shaped id this boot never refused.

 *   no wrapping at all.
