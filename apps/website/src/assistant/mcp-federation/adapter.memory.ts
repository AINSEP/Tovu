/**
 * @file The in-memory doubles for both federation seams — ADR-006 rule-of-two's partner to
 * `adapter.stdio.ts`, and this codebase's usual `repo.memory.ts`/`repo.sqlite.ts` split applied to
 * an outbound protocol boundary instead of a database.
 *
 * One double per seam (see `ports.ts`), and they test different things:
 *
 * - {@link InMemoryMcpSession} fakes `McpSessionPort`, i.e. "an MCP server exists and behaves". It
 *   is what `registrations.ts`'s tests use, so the trust tier and the registration wiring are
 *   exercised with no protocol in the picture at all.
 *
 * - {@link ScriptedMcpStdioChannel} fakes `McpStdioChannel`, i.e. raw newline-delimited JSON-RPC.
 *   It is what `adapter.stdio.ts`'s OWN tests use, so the real client's handshake ordering,
 *   pagination, id correlation, timeout and close behaviour are exercised against something that
 *   can also misbehave on purpose — reply out of order, reply late, reply twice, never reply,
 *   send an unsolicited request, or die mid-flight.
 *
 * - {@link ScriptedMcpHttpExchange} does the same for `McpHttpExchange`, the hosted transport's
 *   seam, so `adapter.http.ts` is under test on the same terms.
 *
 * Those inner-seam doubles are the ones that make the "no live third-party server in this sandbox"
 * constraint survivable: the protocol code under test is the real production code, and only the
 * pipe beneath it is fake. A double at the outer seam alone would have proved only that the double
 * works.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Test doubles. Ships in `src/` beside the port they implement, exactly as every feature's
 * `repo.memory.ts` does, so they are importable from `__tests__/` without a second tsconfig.
