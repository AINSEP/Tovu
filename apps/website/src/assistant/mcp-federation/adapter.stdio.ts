/**
 * @file The real `McpSessionPort` adapter: a minimal MCP client speaking newline-delimited JSON-RPC
 * 2.0 over a child process's stdio, which is the transport every locally-launched MCP server
 * (Supabase's `mcp-server-supabase` bin included) exposes.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Turns "there is a program on disk that speaks MCP" into the three-method
 * `listTools`/`callTool`/`close` port the federation layer depends on. It performs the handshake
 * (`initialize` -> `notifications/initialized`), drains `tools/list` across its cursor pagination,
 * correlates `tools/call` responses by JSON-RPC id, and enforces a timeout on every request.
 *
 * Why hand-rolled rather than `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`:
 * see `ports.ts`'s header. Short version — the SDK is not a dependency here, the wire format needed
 * is four methods of JSON-RPC, and this codebase's convention is a declared port with a real
 * adapter and a double rather than a vendored client.
 *
 * Why the {@link McpStdioChannel} seam:
 * this adapter takes a channel, not a `ChildProcess`. All the logic worth testing — that
 * `initialize` precedes everything, that `notifications/initialized` is sent and carries no id,
 * that a paginated `tools/list` is drained to completion and bounded, that a late reply to a
 * timed-out id is discarded rather than resolving the wrong call, that a channel closing mid-flight
 * rejects every in-flight request instead of hanging forever — is exercisable against a scripted
 * channel with no process at all. `spawnMcpStdioChannel` is the thin, deliberately logic-free
 * production implementation of that seam.
 *
 * Hostile-server posture (this file's share of it; `trust.ts` owns the rest):
 * a remote is assumed to be able to stall, flood, or lie. So: every request is timeout-bounded,
 * pagination is loop-bounded, a single inbound line is length-bounded, unparseable lines are
 * dropped rather than thrown on, and unsolicited server-to-client requests (including
 * `sampling/createMessage` — a remote asking Tovu to run inference on its behalf) are answered with
 * a JSON-RPC "method not found" rather than being honoured. Notifications, `tools/list_changed`
 * among them, are ignored by design: `trust.ts` R5 freezes the admitted set at connect.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Infrastructure adapter, co-located with its port under `assistant/mcp-federation` — mirroring
 * `features/database/adapter.sqlite.ts`'s co-location with the `DatabaseIntrospectionPort` it
 * implements, rather than `db/`'s older per-port-file convention, because this port is this
 * adapter's own invention rather than a cross-domain-shared one.
