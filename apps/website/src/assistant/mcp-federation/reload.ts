/**
 * @file Hot re-admission of federated MCP connections — the piece that lets an owner who finishes an
 * external MCP sign-in (or an operator who saves a ready, non-OAuth connection) see its tools without
 * restarting the daemon. Before this file existed, `agent-daemon-server.ts`'s `start()` called
 * `attachFederatedMcpTools` exactly once, at boot; a connection that did not exist (or was not yet
 * authorized) at that moment contributed no tools until the whole process restarted — see that file's
 * `registerFederationReloadRoute` call site for how an operator-authorized event now reaches here.
 *
 * ## What this does NOT do, on purpose
 *
 * `trust.ts` R5 freezes an ALREADY-ADMITTED connection's tool set at connect, forever, for this
 * process's lifetime — the rug-pull protection that file's own header explains. This module never
 * re-lists, re-classifies, or re-admits a connectionId that has already gone through
 * {@link attachFederatedMcpTools} once, whether that pass ran at boot or at an earlier reload
 * ({@link selectUnadmittedConnections} is the whole enforcement mechanism: a connectionId already in
 * `admittedConnectionIds` is filtered out before `attach` is ever called on it again). It only ever
 * widens the set of connections that have been admitted AT ALL — new rows, never revised ones — which
 * is the same guarantee a fresh boot already gives, just applied to a connection that did not exist
 * yet when this process started. `ToolRegistry` (`@jini-ai/core`) is deliberately append-only with no
 * unregister, so this module still has no way to revise or drop an admitted tool even if it wanted to.
 *
 * That admission freeze no longer means an operator's edit is inert until restart, though —
 * `external-mcp-revocation.ts`'s per-call gate (`mcp-federation/registrations.ts`'s
 * `FederationDeps.assertConnectionUsable`) re-reads the connection's row on every call, independent of
 * this reload path. Turning a connection off, deleting it, disconnecting its OAuth, or narrowing its
 * allowlist or write list all take effect on the very NEXT call, with no restart and no reload
 * required. Widening the allowlist, or changing the server's address, command, args or sign-in method,
 * still needs a real restart: the new tools are never registered, and the old ones refuse as
 * `"changed"` (the row's admission revision no longer matches what the tool was admitted under) until
 * the process restarts and re-admits the connection fresh.
 *
 * ## Concurrency
 *
 * {@link createFederationReloadCoordinator} is the single owner of "which connectionIds have been
 * admitted so far" and serializes every reload attempt through one coalesced, trailing-edge
 * single-flight queue — see {@link FederationReloadCoordinator.reload}'s own doc for why a NAIVE
 * single-flight (return the already-in-flight promise to every caller) is wrong here: it can report
 * success to a caller whose own just-committed connection the in-flight pass never saw. Two operator
 * actions landing close together (two OAuth callbacks finishing within the same tick, or a callback
 * racing an admin PUT) can never interleave into a half-updated `ToolRegistry`, and neither can ever
 * cause the append-only registry's "already registered" throw by attempting the same connectionId
 * twice concurrently.
