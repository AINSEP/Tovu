/**
 * @file GENERIC configuration-resolution scaffolding for federated MCP connections — the parts every
 * vendor preset needs and none of which names a vendor.
 *
 * What this file deliberately does NOT contain, as of 2026-07-30: any specific vendor's preset. The
 * Supabase preset this capability was designed and verified against used to live here; it now lives
 * at `src/features/plugins/supabase-mcp/supabase-mcp-plugin.ts` and registers itself through
 * `presets.ts`. The reasoning is the same one that keeps `store-plugin.ts` and `deploy-plugin.ts` out
 * of `src/server` proper: a concrete vendor integration that ships by default is still an OPTIONAL
 * module, and a reader who finds it inside `src/assistant/` reasonably concludes the assistant
 * REQUIRES it. Nothing in `mcp-federation/` should be readable as "Tovu's assistant needs Supabase".
 *
 * What stays here is the scaffolding a SECOND preset would otherwise have to duplicate: the
 * resolved-connection shape, the shared timeout/size ceilings, and the three env-parsing helpers
 * (enabled-flag, comma list, positive int). Their semantics are the load-bearing part — see each
 * one's own comment — and having exactly one implementation of them is what makes two presets behave
 * the same way about the same kind of setting.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Configuration resolution. Pure apart from reading an injected env bag. No I/O.

/**
 * One fully-resolved federated connection: how to reach it, and the policy to hold it to.
 *
 * This is the whole contract between a vendor preset and core federation. A preset's entire job is
 * to produce one of these (or `null`); everything downstream — `presets.ts`, `bootstrap.ts`,
 * `trust.ts`, `registrations.ts` — is vendor-blind and works off this shape alone.
 *
 * `launch` is TRANSPORT-BLIND too: a local command or a hosted endpoint, and every policy field
 * beside it applies identically to both. That is what lets an operator move a connection from a
 * locally-launched server to the vendor's hosted one without any of the trust machinery noticing.
