/**
 * @file A recording, scriptable `HttpClientPort` test double for the delivery worker.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `processDueDeliveries` (./delivery.ts) depends on `HttpClientPort` (imported from `../http`,
 * ADR-038) to POST signed deliveries. This is NOT the real guarded transport — building that is
 * `src/http`'s job (out of scope here). This is a recording double: every `send()` call is
 * captured for assertions, and responses (or thrown transport errors) are scripted per-call so
 * tests can exercise success, non-2xx failure, and repeated-failure-to-exhaustion paths without
 * a network.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - Satisfies the same `HttpClientPort` interface `../http/ports.ts` declares, so it drops in
 *   wherever the real client would.
 * - Used by `./__tests__/delivery.test.ts`.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Test infrastructure only. Never wired into production composition.
