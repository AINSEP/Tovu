/**
 * @file Password policy (NIST SP 800-63B aligned): a length floor only, no composition rules.
 *
 * NIST SP 800-63B — the current published memorized-secret guidance — recommends a minimum
 * length requirement and explicitly recommends AGAINST composition rules (mandatory uppercase,
 * digit, or symbol). Composition rules measurably push people toward predictable, guessable
 * patterns ("Password1!") rather than genuinely stronger secrets, which is why this module
 * enforces length only.
 *
 * `createUser` (`grant-service.ts`) and `resetUserPassword` (`admin-crud-service.ts`) are the
 * identity system's only two write paths that ever set a password, confirmed by tracing the
 * whole call graph — both call this module.
 *
 * Two things this deliberately does NOT do, both load-bearing:
 * - Never reaches `seed.ts`'s first-boot owner password. `seedIdentity` hashes it directly
 *   (`deps.hasher.hash(ownerPassword)`, `seed.ts:317`) and calls neither `createUser` nor
 *   `resetUserPassword` — confirmed before writing this module. That separation is intentional
 *   to preserve here: the seeded owner default is 8 characters ("tovu-dev", `seed.ts:220`), and
 *   every developer environment (plus any already-running session) authenticates with it.
 *   Enforcing this policy on that path would lock all of them out.
 * - Never re-validates at login. This is a write-time policy — `login`/`verify` never call it.
 *   An account whose password predates this policy (or was seeded) must keep authenticating; NIST
 *   800-63B's own guidance is that length rules apply when a secret is *chosen*, not retroactively
 *   to secrets already in use.

 * CJK/historic scripts) is represented as a surrogate pair per character in a JS string, so plain
 * `.length` overcounts those characters relative to what a human typing them perceives as "12
 * characters" — silently misjudging the exact floor this function states. No trimming, no
 * character allowlist: every printable character, including leading/trailing spaces and full
 * Unicode, is accepted as typed. Silently altering the input (trimming, stripping) would make the
 * stored credential differ from the secret the operator actually chose.
 *
 * @returns `null` if `password` satisfies the policy, otherwise an operator-facing message
 * stating the requirement plainly — used verbatim as the thrown `IdentityValidationError`'s
 * message by both call sites, and rendered as-is through the admin's `describeApiError` layer.
 *
 * @complexity O(n) in the password's length — spreading a string into code points is a single
 * linear pass, which is the minimum work a correct (non-UTF-16-code-unit) count requires.
