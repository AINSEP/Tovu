/**
 * @file The identity (users/roles) agent-tool catalog — the ADR-021 domain's instance of the
 * per-domain `agent-tools.ts` convention already used by `features/content-types`,
 * `features/database`, and `features/recovery`.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * A static, in-process catalog describing every agent-callable identity tool and the permission
 * each one carries. `assistant/tool-registrations.ts` maps these entries onto handlers that call
 * `grant-service.ts` / `admin-crud-service.ts` — the SAME functions the human admin routes under
 * `server/routes/admin/users/` call. There is deliberately no path from a tool to the database
 * that skips those functions, because they are where ADR-021's gates live.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CATALOG DELIBERATELY OMITS, and why (ADR-021 makes identity the escalation-dense
 * surface, so the omissions are part of the design rather than a backlog):
 *
 *   - `resetUserPassword` (SPEC-006 REQ-17). The one identity transition that sets a credential on
 *     an account the caller does not own, and — unlike `ASSIGN_ROLE`/`ATTACH_POLICY` — it carries
 *     NO INV-07 grant-authority clamp. A `user.manage` holder may reset the OWNER's password and
 *     then authenticate as owner, so it is a full account-takeover primitive rather than a
 *     permission grant. An assistant is reachable by prompt injection through ordinary operator
 *     content (a form submission, a comment) in a way a human clicking the admin button is not.
 *     Left human-UI-only, mirroring `features/content-types/agent-tools.ts`'s reasoning for never
 *     exposing the destructive-cleanup confirm() step to an agent.
 *   - `writePolicyPermission` (SPEC-006 0.6.0, INV-07). This is the one policy transition still
 *     deliberately excluded, and on different grounds than the five wired below: unlike
 *     `identity_role_assign`/`identity_policy_attach`, which each confer whatever a role/policy
 *     ALREADY carries onto exactly one named target principal, `writePolicyPermission` MUTATES a
 *     shared, reusable `PolicyRecord` in place — and any non-built-in, non-frozen policy can
 *     already be attached to an arbitrary number of OTHER users via `identity_policy_attach` (or to
 *     roles via the seed-only `role_policies` table) before this call happens. The INV-07 clamp
 *     (`assertGrantClamp`) still bounds WHAT the caller can add — only a permission it itself holds
 *     unconstrained — but it says nothing about WHO ends up holding it: every principal already
 *     attached to that policy inherits the new permission the instant it is written, invisibly to
 *     whoever asked for the one change. That is a materially different blast-radius shape than the
 *     single-target primitives this catalog does wire (see the tool descriptions below), and exactly
 *     the "grant that ripples to principals never named in the call" class this pass's directive
 *     asks to be excluded and explained rather than wired reflexively. Left human-UI-only, where
 *     `apps/admin/src/sections/Roles.tsx`'s "Add permission" control still lives.
 *
 * Every OTHER policy transition (`identity_policy_list`, `identity_policy_create`,
 * `identity_policy_update`, `identity_policy_delete`, `identity_policy_attach`) IS wired below,
 * mirroring the risk profile this catalog already accepted for the equivalent role transitions
 * (`identity_role_list`/`identity_role_create`/`identity_role_rename`/`identity_role_delete`/
 * `identity_role_assign`) — see each entry's own description for why its shape matches its role
 * counterpart exactly.
 *
 *   - Role REVOCATION. Not a choice: no such operation exists anywhere in this codebase.
 *     `PrincipalRoleRepoPort` (`ports.ts`) declares `listByPrincipalId`, `save`, and `listByRoleId`
 *     — there is no `delete`, and no service function unassigns a role. A tool cannot be written
 *     against an operation the domain does not have, and adding a repo-level delete here to
 *     manufacture one would be exactly the "skip the service layer" failure this work exists to
 *     close. The same is true of "detach a policy from a principal" — `PrincipalPolicyRepoPort`
 *     has no delete either, so `identity_policy_attach` is one-directional exactly like
 *     `identity_role_assign`.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `identity` library declaration only. Performs no I/O and no enforcement — `authorize()` and each
 * service function's own caller-permission gate enforce at call time. The local
 * `AgentToolSideEffect`/`AgentToolActorClassRule`/`AgentToolDefinition` declarations mirror the
 * house convention: `features/database/agent-tools.ts` and `features/recovery/agent-tools.ts` each
 * declare their own structurally identical copy rather than importing another module's, so a
 * low-level library like `identity` never acquires a dependency on a feature module.
