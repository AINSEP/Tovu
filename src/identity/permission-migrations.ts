/**
 * @file Shared deprecate-old/grant-new permission migration mechanism
 * (ADR-PIPE-012 C-001/C-002, generalized from the `settings.write` ->
 * `settings.definitions.manage` precedent already shipped ad hoc in
 * `identity/seed.ts`/`identity/permissions.ts`).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * A permission-string rename/split after real grants exist is a breaking
 * migration (`sweep-crosscutting-decisions-20260710.md` §E). This module is
 * the one place that fan-out runs, so Menus/Members/Analytics/Integrations
 * remediation ADRs each register their own `{from, to}` pair here instead of
 * hand-rolling a fourth divergent copy of the same fix.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - `registerPermissionMigration`/`listPermissionMigrations` are a small,
 *   in-process registry — pure metadata, no I/O, mirrors
 *   `permissions.ts`'s `PermissionCatalog.register` overwrite semantics.
 * - `migrateDeprecatedPermissionGrants` is the actual grant fan-out: for
 *   every registered pair, every policy holding `from` gets every string in
 *   `to` it doesn't already hold. It is deliberately, structurally
 *   additive-only (INV-NEW-01) — there is no delete/update call against
 *   `policy_permissions` anywhere in this file.
 * - Feature-agnostic by design: this module has zero knowledge of
 *   `navigation`/`settings`/any specific feature. Callers (e.g.
 *   `identity/permissions.ts`) register their own pairs.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Security-adjacent domain logic (ADR-PIPE-012 Quality Attribute Scorecard,
 * security axis 3/5) — a bug here could fail-open (grant more than intended)
 * or fail-closed (a policy silently missing a needed grant) across every
 * feature that reuses it. The additive-only design bounds the fail-closed
 * direction to "a required new permission is missing," never "an existing
 * permission is removed." See `__tests__/permission-migrations.test.ts` for
 * the dedicated fixture-driven certification this ADR requires before any
 * caller wires this into a live boot path.
