/**
 * SPEC-022 REQ-03/W-001 — must run and pass before any composition/route-registration work
 * starts. Deliberately placed here (the actual process entrypoint), not inside `deps.ts`'s
 * `createSqliteRouteDeps()` / `app.ts`'s `createApp()`: both of those are synchronous functions
 * called from hundreds of existing hermetic tests, and forcing them async (or awaiting a gate
 * before they can return) would be a wide, risky, untested signature change to every one of
 * those call sites — INV-06 forbids exactly that kind of collateral behavior change. `index.ts`
 * is the one real top-level boot path (never imported by a test), so it is the safe place to
 * enforce "never bind the listening socket" without touching any tested surface.
 *
 * `envSnapshot`'s three checks are a disclosed, best-effort implementation, not exhaustively
 * specified by SPEC-022 (no test exercises the real heuristics, only injected fixture values):
 * - `hasDevSecretPlaceholder`: true when `ANALYTICS_ROOT_KEY_SEED` is unset, since
 *   `registerAnalyticsIngestRoute`'s wiring in `app.ts` falls back to the literal dev placeholder
 *   `"dev-only-insecure-seed"` whenever that env var is absent.
 * - `hasLocalhostEgressAllowance`: not yet detectable here — `deps.ts` seeds a hardcoded
 *   `localhost`/`example.com` origin+egress-allowlist unconditionally, with no env-var escape
 *   hatch, so this check cannot yet distinguish a real deploy from a dev one. Flagged as a real
 *   gap for whoever scopes the origin-seed-becomes-configurable follow-up; not fixed here.
 * - `hasAlwaysOnAnalyticsStub`: always true today — `deps.ts` has no way to select a durable
 *   analytics sink yet (Phase 1 territory); this mirrors the "analytics" capability-inventory
 *   entry's own `hasDurableAdapter: false`.
