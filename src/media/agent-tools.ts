/**
 * @file The Media agent-tool catalog (ADR-027) — this domain's instance of the per-domain
 * `agent-tools.ts` convention `forms/agent-tools.ts` and `identity/agent-tools.ts` already use.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * A static, in-process catalog describing every agent-callable tool this domain exposes and the
 * permission each carries. Every entry maps 1:1 onto a real exported function of
 * `media/media-service.ts` — this catalog never names an operation the domain cannot perform.
 *
 * Deliberate absences (the point of a catalog, not an oversight):
 * - There is NO `media_purge_asset`. `purgeMedia` is a HARD delete: it removes the `MediaRecord`
 *   row permanently and triggers the blob-GC tombstone pass (`tombstoneBlobIfUnreferenced`,
 *   `blob-gc.ts`) that can eventually reclaim the underlying bytes. It is gated behind
 *   `media.delete.force` — a separate, narrower permission the human admin UI itself treats as a
 *   distinct escalation tier from ordinary `media.delete` (mirrors `admin.menus.delete` vs
 *   `admin.menus.delete.force`). An assistant is reachable by prompt injection through ordinary
 *   operator content (a comment, a form submission) in a way a human clicking the admin "purge"
 *   button is not, so an irreversible, storage-reclaiming delete is left human-UI-only — the same
 *   discipline `identity/agent-tools.ts` applies to `resetUserPassword`.
 * - There is NO named-transform-registry tool (`registerTransform`, `media/transform-registry.ts`).
 *   No admin HTTP route exposes it at all (`server/routes/admin/media/*.ts` has only
 *   upload/list/update/trash/delete) — it is a core-declared, boot-time/operational concept, not a
 *   human admin-UI operation. Wrapping it here would invent agent capability beyond what the human
 *   admin surface itself exposes, which this catalog's own discipline forbids.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * `assistant/tool-registrations.ts` maps these entries into `@jini-ai/core` `ToolRegistration`s.
 * Unlike Forms/Identity, `media-service.ts`'s functions perform NO internal `authorize()` call of
 * their own (confirmed: none of `UploadMediaDeps`/`UpdateMediaMetadataDeps`/`TrashMediaDeps` carry
 * an `authorize` field) — every admin HTTP route in `server/routes/admin/media/*.ts` checks
 * `deps.authorize(...)` inline, before calling the service function. `tool-registrations.ts`
 * therefore performs that SAME inline `authorize()` call itself (the identical permission string
 * and `entityType: "media"` the HTTP route uses) rather than relying on a domain-layer gate that
 * does not exist for this library — a disclosed, deliberate divergence from the Forms/Identity/
 * content-types pass-through-`ToolPolicy` reasoning, not an oversight.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `media` domain declaration. Imports only the constants its own domain already enforces
 * (`DEFAULT_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`/`DEFAULT_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES` from `media-service.ts`), so the
 * published JSON Schemas cannot drift from the validators.
