/**
 * @file Generic in-process keyed mutex factory, extracted from
 * `blob-gc-lock.ts`'s `withSha256Lock` shape (ADR-027 §5 INV-1's
 * "Serialization" clause) so the same FIFO-per-key critical-section pattern
 * can back two independent lock namespaces this task needs:
 *
 *  - `withTransformRegistryLock` — serializes `registerTransform`'s
 *    read-max-version-then-insert-next-version sequence per `(workspaceId,
 *    name)`, so two concurrent registrations of the same name can't both
 *    read the same "current max" and mint a colliding version.
 *  - `withRenditionLock` — serializes lazy rendition generation per
 *    `(sha256, transformName, version)` (ADR-027 §4 "single-flight"), so two
 *    concurrent requests for the same not-yet-generated rendition never run
 *    `sharp` twice.
 *
 * `blob-gc-lock.ts` itself is untouched — this is a new, separate module,
 * not a modification of that file's exports (its shape is deliberately
 * mirrored here, not imported, per this task's explicit scope: reuse the
 * pattern, don't touch the blob-GC lock's existing signature).

/**
 * Creates one independent keyed-lock namespace: calls sharing the same `key`
 * are strictly FIFO-ordered; calls for different keys run fully
 * concurrently. A rejection in one critical section does not poison the lock
 * for later callers on the same key (each waits for its predecessor to
 * *settle*, not to succeed) — identical semantics to `withSha256Lock`.
 *
 * @complexity O(1) scheduling overhead per call; total wait time is bounded
 * by the number of other calls currently queued for the same key.
