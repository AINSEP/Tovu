/**
 * @file Domain types + typed errors for the `media` library (ADR-027).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `MediaRecord` is the editorial half of a media asset; `AssetBlobRecord` and
 * `AssetRenditionRecord` are the two core-owned operational sidecars ADR-027
 * §2 specifies.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE (disclosed, not a silent deviation): ADR-027 describes media as a
 * seeded `entries` content-type entry (ADR-022) — editorial fields live under
 * `bodyJson.$.source`/`fields.ext.media.*` on a generic entry row, with
 * revisions/taxonomy/`entry_refs` for free. That generic `entries` model does
 * not exist as running code in this repo yet (ADR-022 is ACCEPTED design only;
 * `post` itself is still a bespoke first-class table, not a generic entry — see
 * `src/features/post/post.ts`). `MediaRecord` below is therefore built the same
 * way `PostRecord` is built: a bespoke record with its editorial fields inlined
 * directly, exactly mirroring the `post` precedent. When the generic entries
 * system ships, `media` should migrate onto it the same way `post` eventually
 * will — this file is not a competing permanent design, it is `post`'s pattern
 * applied to media.
 *
 * The two sidecars (`AssetBlobRecord`, `AssetRenditionRecord`) ARE built as
 * ADR-027 §2 describes — they were always meant to be core-owned tables
 * independent of the entries model, so no scope adjustment was needed there.

 * `source` set at creation time by `uploadMedia` (never a row without bytes,
 * ADR-027 §5 ordering), so in practice the absent state is transient/internal
