/**
 * @file The transport-INDEPENDENT half of Tovu's minimal MCP client: the JSON-RPC envelope shapes,
 * the handshake constants, and the narrowing of everything a remote server sends back.
 *
 * Why this file exists:
 * `adapter.stdio.ts` and `adapter.http.ts` differ only in how bytes move. Every decision about what
 * a `tools/list` page means, which cursor to follow, how many pages to follow, what a `tools/call`
 * result is allowed to look like, and which fields survive narrowing is identical across both —
 * because it is the PROTOCOL, not the pipe. Duplicating it into the second adapter would have
 * created two copies of this codebase's untrusted-input narrowing that could silently disagree,
 * which is the failure mode the narrowing exists to prevent.
 *
 * Everything here treats its input as HOSTILE. A remote server controls every byte parsed by this
 * file: tool names, descriptions, schemas, annotations, cursors, results. This file's job is to
 * turn that into well-typed values or drop it — never to trust it, and never to throw on it where
 * dropping would do. The trust decisions themselves belong to `trust.ts`; see `ports.ts`'s header
 * for the split.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Pure functions and constants. No I/O, no state, no transport knowledge.
