/**
 * @file ADR-031 §5 — the local heuristic `SpamCheckPort` adapter (ADR-006 rule-of-two "built
 * now" half; an external service adapter, e.g. Akismet-style, is the plausible-next second
 * adapter — not built this pass, see SPEC-033 Non-Goals). No network I/O.
 *
 * Signals, combined into a `[0,1]` score:
 * - link density in the body (a common comment-spam signal — many URLs per short body);
 * - a small keyword list of common spam phrases;
 * - an implausibly long body (wall-of-text link farms);
 * - an implausibly short body with a link (drive-by link drops).
