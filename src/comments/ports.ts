/**
 * @file Port contracts introduced by the Comments bundled plugin (ADR-031).
 *
 * Two ports, each passing ADR-006's rule-of-two (two plausible adapters, one built now):
 *   1. `CommentRepoPort`  — in-memory (now) + SQLite-over-dataModule (now). The typed, core-owned
 *      write path ADR-023 §7 mandates for plugin tables: no raw plugin write SQL, so the ADR-022
 *      write chokepoint (revision + `pluginId` attribution) is preserved.
 *   2. `SpamCheckPort`    — heuristic/local (built now) + external service e.g. Akismet (plausible
 *      next). This is the brief's anti-spam seam.
 *
 * `CommentIngressPolicy` is the core-mediated public-submission boundary (NOT a rule-of-two port —
 * one policy, like ADR-027's single `MediaIngressPolicy`): anonymous submission cannot ride
 * `authorize()` RBAC, so it enters here — rate-limited, spam-checked, sanitized — and is the only
 * write path a hostile visitor can reach.
 *
 * All cross-seam payloads are async + serializable, no live core objects (ADR-024 §3, ADR-025 §2).
 * INTERFACES + TYPES ONLY — no feature logic lives here.
