/**
 * @file Core type definitions for the Tovu `routing` Tier-2 library (ADR-039 v0).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Declares the `RouteTarget` vocabulary, the workspace-scoped resolve context,
 * the inverse-resolver result shape, the forward resolution pipeline's phase
 * vocabulary, and the `SlugChangeCapture` slot's payload shape. This is the one
 * place `entryRef | termRef | url | route` is defined — promoted from
 * Menus-local (ADR-029 §3) to routing-owned per ADR-039 §3, so Menus/SEO/
 * Redirects share one vocabulary instead of inventing three.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - `core/ports.ts` supplies the shared primitives (`UUID`, `ISODateTime`, …).
 * - `routing/ports.ts` declares the dependency shape `urlFor`/`isActive` need
 *   (the existing `PostRepoPort`, reused rather than duplicated).
 * - `routing/routing.ts` implements the resolve functions against these types.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * INTERFACES + TYPES ONLY (no feature logic). ADR-039 v0 is deliberately the
 * minimal shape three other sections depend on; full permalink-structure
 * design is explicitly deferred (ADR-039 "Open").

 * — the slot is core-resident by definition).
 *
 * Constraints on any bound implementation (Round-2 amendment 2): idempotent by
 * `changeSetId`, no external I/O, no in-tx publish (an outbox row may be
 * written in-tx per the transactional-outbox pattern, but dispatch happens
 * post-commit), and a strict lock order of content row before redirect rows.

 * slug-preservation is disabled for the workspace. Once link-preservation is
 * enabled, a slug-changing rename with no bound capture MUST fail
 * `LINK_PRESERVATION_UNAVAILABLE` rather than silently skip the redirect. That
 * enforcement belongs to the content write chokepoint (which knows whether
 * preservation is enabled) and to Redirects (which doesn't exist yet in this
 * repo) — this library only exposes the registration slot.
