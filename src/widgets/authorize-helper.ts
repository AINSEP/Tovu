/**
 * @file Shared `authorize()` plumbing for `write-service.ts`/`region-area-service.ts` (SPEC-043
 * REQ-40/41, INV-07).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `AuthorizeFn` mirrors `features/entries/write-service.ts`'s `AuthorizeFn` shape structurally (no
 * shared import, kept decoupled — the same "no shared import" convention that file's own header
 * documents against `features/content-types`). `requireWidgetPermission` is the ONE place a
 * `widgets.*` permission string gets checked before a mutation proceeds.
 *
 * `PRE_AUTHORIZED` exists because this library composes `features/entries/write-service.ts`'s
 * `createEntry`/`updateEntry` and `features/content-types/write-service.ts`'s `registerContentType`
 * — both of which perform their OWN internal `authorize()` call, hardcoded to the
 * `admin.collections.manage` permission (the generic Collections-domain permission, unrelated to
 * widgets' own `widgets.*` model, and not modifiable — see this task's scope boundary on
 * `features/entries`). Since the real, authoritative check for a widget mutation is the
 * `widgets.*` check `requireWidgetPermission` already performed one layer up, `PRE_AUTHORIZED` is
 * passed as those composed functions' own `authorize` dependency so their internal check is not a
 * second, differently-scoped gate a legitimate `widgets.*`-holding caller could be incorrectly
 * rejected by.
