/**
 * @file `contact-form` widget resolver (SPEC-043 REQ-36..39, ADR-047 Debate Fold-In Amendment 4).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * A thin, READ-ONLY adapter over `src/forms/`'s definition read side. Imports ONLY the read-only
 * `FormDefinitionRepoPort` type, through `forms/index.ts` (ADR-009 §1's barrel; the type is
 * declared in `forms/ports.ts`) — never the Forms library's own submission write path or its
 * outbox-driven mail-notification module — so this file can never persist a submission, send
 * mail, rate-limit, or duplicate any part of the Forms pipeline (INV-08, hard invariant; verified
 * by a code-review-level grep over this whole package for those two module names, which must
 * return nothing).
 *
 * REQ-37 ("reads the referenced Forms definition's declared field vocabulary — never a hardcoded
 * field-type list") is honored here: `definition.fields` (Forms' own `FieldDescriptor[]`) is passed
 * through as IR props verbatim, not re-enumerated against a widget-local field-kind switch. The
 * actual submission still posts to Forms' existing public route unmodified (REQ-37's second half) —
 * that is a render-component/route concern, out of this resolver's scope (no HTTP route exists yet
 * for widgets in this slice; see the implementation report's scope-boundary notes).
