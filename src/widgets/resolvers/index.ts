/**
 * @file `CORE_RESOLVERS` — the closed, core-owned resolver dispatch map (SPEC-043 REQ-08/09/10/23;
 * ADR-047 Debate Fold-In Amendment 2/3).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The ONE place a registry's `resolverId` string resolves against real, executable code. A
 * `WidgetTypeRegistration.resolverId` is never used as a dynamic import path, `eval`-style
 * reference, or arbitrary function lookup anywhere else in this codebase (REQ-08) — this map is
 * the sole allowlist. `resolveWidgetType` is the dispatcher every page render goes through
 * (`resolver-service.ts`'s `resolvePageWidgets` calls this, once per distinct type present),
 * and it owns the try/catch + timeout boundary so a resolver's exception or hang can never
 * propagate past a widget's placement boundary (REQ-27, INV-05).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * TDD-certified stub (implementation outline C-003). The dispatcher's failure-isolation
 * contract is design-frozen from SPEC-043; the body throws until the Programmer stage implements
 * against `__tests__/integration/resolver-service.integration.test.ts`.

 *
 * Typed `Readonly<...>` so every ordinary caller gets a compile-time guarantee this map is never
 * mutated ad hoc from outside `registerCoreResolver`/`wireCoreResolvers` — the certified test
 * suite's direct-assignment test-double seam (`CORE_RESOLVERS["recent-entries"] = resolver`)
 * deliberately overrides that guarantee with `@ts-expect-error`, since at runtime this is the same
 * plain, mutable object `mutableResolvers` is (TypeScript's `readonly` has no runtime effect) —
 * this is intentional, not a bug: it lets the test suite swap in failure-injecting test doubles
 * without a second, parallel test-only export.
