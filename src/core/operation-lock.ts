/**
 * @file CIC U-001 (SPEC-019 `critical-internal-constraints.md`) — site-wide gated-operation
 * mutual exclusion (C-309; REQ-13, INV-03; GOV-ADR-002).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The single, shared primitive both `features/storage` (SPEC-017, migrate-forward) and
 * `features/recovery` (SPEC-019, restore) MUST consult before starting a gated operation. Two
 * domains racing to mutate the same site's `content.db` must never both be "in flight" — the
 * primitive tracks in-flight state per `siteId` only, never per-domain, so it cannot be defeated
 * by two domain-local checks that happen to look similar (U-001-B1).
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * `executeMigrateForward` and `executeRestore` both call `acquireOperationLock` as the provably
 * first side-effecting step of their own orchestration (U-001-ORD1), and `releaseOperationLock`
 * once the operation concludes (success or failure).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Core primitive. In-process only (module-singleton registry) — a site's operations are already
 * serialized to a single process by `content.db`'s own single-writer model; this primitive adds
 * the cross-domain intent-level guard on top of that.
 *
 * ADR-041/043/044/045 re-audit (2026-07-16, TM-adr041-043-044-045-audit-001, Finding 3):
 * the internal verifier's original claim — "never wired into any composition root" — is false,
 * disproven by direct evidence: `server/routes/admin/storage/migrate-forward.ts` and
 * `server/routes/admin/recovery/restore.ts` both import `acquireOperationLock`/
 * `releaseOperationLock` from this file directly and pass them into `executeMigrateForward`/
 * `executeRestore` (their `execute` endpoints only). The mutual-exclusion guarantee (U-001) is
 * real and live for both gated ceremonies today. The actual, narrower gap the re-audit surfaced:
 * this module had no read-only query, so `routes/admin/recovery/status.ts`'s capability bar
 * could not reflect live lock state and stubbed `operationInFlight: false` unconditionally.
 * `isOperationInFlight` below closes that display gap without changing the mutual-exclusion
 * mechanism itself.
