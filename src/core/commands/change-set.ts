/**
 * @file Change-set vocabulary and persistence contract (ADR-008).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Defines the durable rows that make every mutation auditable and revertible,
 * for human and AI actors alike.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - `command.ts` records one change set per executed command.
 * - `revert.ts` walks items in reverse to undo an applied change set.
 * - `repo.memory.ts` provides the in-memory adapter for local dev/tests.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * This is the storage shape ADR-008 requires to land with the first persistent
 * schema. SQLite/Postgres adapters must satisfy `ChangeSetRepoPort` unchanged.
 *
 * BR-04 resolution (ADR-046 Phase 1, 2026-07-16 swarm debate, full record:
 * `ADS-project-knowledge/reports/swarm-consensus/runs/20260716T-br04-outbox-seam-consensus-report.md`):
 * `insert()`'s optional third argument lets the caller pass the fully-formed outbox event through
 * the SAME call, so a durable adapter can co-persist it inside the same transaction as the header
 * + items — chosen over threading a transaction handle through `OutboxPort`/`mutation.execute()`
 * because Drizzle's better-sqlite3 `transaction()` is synchronous while both ports are async; an
 * async handle cannot be awaited inside a sync transaction callback without an unsafe held-open
 * transaction or a new, zero-consumer abstraction. This does NOT bring the domain write
 * (`mutation.execute()`) into the transaction — that remains covered by `executeCommand()`'s
 * existing compensating-rollback path until ADR-046 Phase 3.
