/**
 * @file Minimal `psql` shell-out helper for tests that prove semantics against a real, local
 * Postgres server.
 *
 * Why shell out rather than use a driver: no `pg`/`postgres` npm package is installed in this repo
 * yet (`src/db/postgres/db-ops.ts` is explicitly evaluation-only per its own header — see the
 * postgres-supabase-database-backend-spec.md architecture doc). Adding one is a real dependency
 * decision this task was explicitly told not to make unilaterally. `psql` is already on the host
 * running these tests, so it is the only way to prove behavior against a live server without adding
 * a new runtime dependency mid-task. This file is TEST INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY — nothing in
 * `manifest.ts`/`verify.ts` depends on it, and it must never be imported from product code.

/** Defaults match the fixture Postgres this repo's dispatch brief describes: Homebrew Postgres 14
 * listening on the Unix socket in `/tmp`, role `la`, no password (peer/trust auth on the socket).
 * `PGHOST`/`PGPORT`/`PGUSER` (standard libpq env var names) override these defaults so CI can point
 * this at a TCP service container instead of a developer's local socket. When unset, behavior is
 * byte-for-byte identical to before this file read the environment — every local dev run is
 * unaffected. `PGPASSWORD`, if set, needs no code here: `spawnSync` inherits the parent process's
 * environment by default, and `psql` itself already honors `PGPASSWORD` natively.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT overridable via env: `ADMIN_DATABASE` below stays a hardcoded `"postgres"` so a
 * stray or misconfigured env var can never redirect the *admin* connection target. Only the *server*
 * address (host/port/user) is configurable here — never which database on that server gets dropped by
 * `recreateDatabase()`/`dropDatabase()` (that's always the caller-supplied `database` argument, e.g.
 * the distinctively-named `tovu_migration_fixture`, not this constant). */
