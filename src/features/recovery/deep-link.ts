/**
 * @file SPEC-019 C-306 / REQ-20 / REQ-21 / INV-04 — deep-link envelope resolution (ADR-045 §5,
 * ADR-041 §7).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `resolveDeepLinkContext` never trusts a `DatabaseContextEnvelope`'s carried values — every id is
 * independently re-looked-up server-side on arrival (INV-04). A stale, pruned, or outright forged
 * `restorePointId` (even one that is syntactically plausible, e.g. ULID-shaped) resolves to
 * `{found:false}` rather than proceeding with the envelope's own claimed value — the envelope
 * carries display continuity only, never authority (ADR-041 §7's own rule, restated for this
 * domain's receiving side).
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * Isolated into its own file specifically so this mandatory re-verification rule is a single,
 * reviewable unit (ADR-PIPE-019 File Map) — every other Recovery surface that renders envelope
 * context must route through this function rather than reading `envelope.restorePointId` directly.
