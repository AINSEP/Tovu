/**
 * @file The guard on the agent-writable allowlist.
 *
 * `agent-writable-preferences.ts` is a hand-maintained list that claims to be a SUBSET of what
 * `ui-tab-definitions.ts` registers at boot. Nothing in the type system enforces that claim, and
 * the two failure modes it protects against are asymmetric:
 *
 * - An entry naming a key boot does NOT register fails at call time, from inside the write
 *   chokepoint, as a `DefinitionNotFoundError` — on a tool the model was already told it could
 *   call. Annoying, and visible.
 * - An entry naming a key whose scope mask omits `user` would be silently written at a scope the
 *   definition never opted into, or refused for a reason the operator cannot see. Worse, and
 *   quiet.
 *
 * So the assertions here run boot's own registration against a real repo and compare, rather than
 * restating the expected list — a second hand-maintained copy would drift in exactly the same way
 * the first one can.
