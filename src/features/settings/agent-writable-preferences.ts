/**
 * @file The curated list of setting keys an agent may write — the precondition
 * `features/settings/agent-tools.ts`'s header named, now that it exists.
 *
 * ## Why this file had to exist before any settings write could be wired
 *
 * `agent-tools.ts` excludes `settings_set`/`settings_clear`/`settings_reset`/
 * `settings_register_definitions` from agent callability, and its reasoning is a factual claim
 * about the codebase rather than a blanket policy:
 *
 * > "There is no fixed, curated list of named settings anywhere in this codebase's admin surface
 * > to wire tools against."
 *
 * That was accurate when written. `features/settings/ui-tab-definitions.ts` has since made it
 * false: it registers a fixed, statically-declared set of keys — each with a schema, a default,
 * and a scope mask — because the settings-dialog tabs need named keys to bind to. This module is
 * the subset of THAT list which is safe for an agent to write.
 *
 * The exclusion's sharpest objection was that schema validation "constrains the VALUE shape, not
 * WHICH key is targeted". That is exactly right about the generic setter, and exactly what
 * {@link AGENT_WRITABLE_PREFERENCE_IDS} fixes: it is published as a JSON Schema `enum`, so the
 * targeted key is constrained by the same mechanism that constrains everything else in the tool
 * surface. The two halves together are complete — this file bounds WHICH key, and the ledger's
 * own registered definition schema bounds the VALUE (`write-service.ts`'s `set()` validates
 * against it and rejects a mismatch before any write lands).
 *
 * So the generic setter stays excluded, permanently and for its original reason. This is the
 * curated alternative that exclusion explicitly pointed at, not a relaxation of it.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately NOT here
 *
 * `ui-tab-definitions.ts` registers 12 keys. Five are withheld:
 *
 * - **`core.privacy.telemetry.metrics` / `telemetry.content` / `decisionAt` / `installationId`** —
 *   a telemetry consent record whose entire purpose is to attest that a HUMAN decided. An agent
 *   writing it would not be recording a decision, it would be manufacturing one, and `decisionAt`
 *   is specifically the field the tab reads to know whether to stop asking. Withheld because the
 *   value means something different depending on who wrote it — the one property a curated
 *   allowlist cannot express.
 * - **`core.instructions.custom`** — the custom instructions prepended to every admin-assistant
 *   conversation. An agent writing this edits its own standing prompt for all future runs. That
 *   may well be worth allowing later, but it is a self-modification question and not a display
 *   preference, so it does not ride in on the same decision.
 *
 * Every key that IS here is a per-operator display preference: reversible in one call, scoped to
 * the caller's own user layer, and visible in the admin UI the moment it changes — which is what
 * makes the whole surface auditable by looking at it.
 *
 * ## Architectural role
 *
 * `features/settings` domain data. No I/O, no enforcement — `tool-registrations.ts` performs the
 * `authorize()` call and the write. Kept as data rather than inlined into the catalog so the tool
 * schema, the handler's dispatch, and the drift test all read the same source.
