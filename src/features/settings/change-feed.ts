/**
 * @file Decides which ledger revisions a given caller may be TOLD about, and which namespaces that
 * implies. The transport half lives in `server/routes/admin/settings/events.ts`; this is the pure
 * logic so it can be tested without an HTTP server or a clock.
 *
 * ## Why a change feed exists at all
 *
 * A settings write made in one process is invisible to an already-rendered admin tab in another.
 * That was true for the agent daemon (a separate OS process) and it is equally true for a second
 * browser tab, another operator, or a background job. The revision ledger is the one place every
 * write lands regardless of who made it, and its `seq` is a monotonic autoincrement in shared
 * storage — so polling it is cross-process by construction, needing no IPC and no message broker.
 *
 * ## The disclosure rule
 *
 * A subscriber must not learn that settings it cannot read have changed. Even a bare namespace name
 * is a signal — "someone else's preferences just changed" is information the caller was never
 * granted. {@link isRevisionVisibleTo} is therefore an allowlist, not a denylist: an unrecognized
 * scope is withheld rather than passed through, so a future scope added to `SettingScope` is
 * invisible until someone decides what it should mean here.
 *
 * Nothing in the emitted payload carries a VALUE. Subscribers receive namespace names and re-read
 * through the ordinary authorized `getSettingsEffective` path, which is what keeps this module's
 * responsibility narrow: it decides who hears that something moved, never what it moved to.
