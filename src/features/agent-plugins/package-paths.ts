/**
 * @file The one path-safety primitive every Agent Plugin package read goes through — extraction
 * (`install.ts`) today, any future preview/read path tomorrow. One implementation, not two, so the
 * containment guarantee cannot drift between "how a package is written" and "how it is later read".
 *
 * The rule is not invented here. The Agent Plugins spec (v1.0.0, "Path safety") states it as a MUST:
 * "the filesystem-resolved path MUST remain within the filesystem-resolved plugin root... symlinks,
 * junctions, reparse points, and equivalent filesystem mechanisms MAY resolve to targets within the
 * plugin root, but clients MUST reject package paths that resolve outside it." The word
 * "filesystem-resolved" is exactly what a lexical `../`-string check alone does not satisfy — a
 * hostile archive can plant a symlinked directory at a lexically-clean path and let a later,
 * innocent-looking entry walk through it (the two-step zip-slip vector; see `install.ts`'s header
 * for the extraction-time mitigation, which is to refuse symlink ENTRIES outright rather than ever
 * relying on this function to catch one after the fact).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Pure path logic plus the minimum filesystem calls (`realpath`) the spec's own wording requires.
 * No policy about what happens after containment is established — that is every caller's own job.
