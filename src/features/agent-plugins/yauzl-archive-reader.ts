/**
 * @file The real `AgentPluginArchiveReaderPort` adapter, backed by `yauzl`.
 *
 * Library choice (owner-decided, recorded so it is not re-litigated): `yauzl` — streaming,
 * memory-efficient, built for a backend service parsing an untrusted uploaded archive; it enforces
 * no policy of its own, which is exactly the shape this codebase's port+adapter discipline wants —
 * `install.ts` owns every containment/size/entry-kind rule, this file only turns zip bytes into the
 * `AgentPluginArchiveEntry` shape `install.ts` already knows how to harden against. Rejected:
 * `extract-zip` (bundles its own path sanitization and writes to disk itself — it would extract
 * past the caps `install.ts` enforces mid-stream, fighting this module's own hardening rather than
 * feeding it); `adm-zip` (loads the whole archive into memory and blocks the event loop — the
 * opposite of what a 32MB-capped but still untrusted upload should do); `node-unzip-2` (deprecated,
 * known vulnerabilities). If the choice changes later, only this file and its own tests should need
 * to move — `AgentPluginArchiveReaderPort` is the seam precisely so a library swap never touches
 * `install.ts`'s hardening logic.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Symlink detection — the one thing this file has to get right that yauzl doesn't do for you
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The base ZIP spec has no first-class symlink concept. The de facto convention (Info-ZIP, Python's
 * `zipfile`, and this module's own `yazl`-based test fixtures all follow it) is: when an entry's
 * "version made by" upper byte names a Unix host (`3`), the upper 16 bits of `externalFileAttributes`
 * are the Unix `st_mode`, and a symlink is `(mode & S_IFMT) === S_IFLNK` — the entry's own content
 * (its "file data") is the link target text. This module never reads that content: `install.ts`
 * rejects every symlink-kind entry outright before any content read would matter, so decoding the
 * target string would be pure waste against bytes that are about to be refused anyway.
 *
 * A zip with NO Unix "version made by" (host byte != 3, e.g. an archiver that only sets the MS-DOS
 * convention) reports `externalFileAttributes`' upper bits as meaningless — this module only
 * consults them when the host byte says Unix, so an ordinary non-Unix-authored zip is never
 * misclassified as containing a symlink it doesn't have.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Adapter only — no policy. Every hardening rule this module's header cites lives in `install.ts`
 * and is exercised against BOTH the scripted double (`install.unit.test.ts`) and this real reader
 * (`__tests__/unit/yauzl-archive-reader.unit.test.ts`), per the team directive that the adversarial
 * suite is the acceptance criteria for a real archive library, not just for the double.
