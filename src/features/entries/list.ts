 * injected read port, no authorization of its own (the caller route checks `admin.collections.read`
 * first).
 *
 * `status`/`orderBy`/`limit` (2026-07-21) — added to close a real, audit-confirmed gap
 * (`widgets/resolvers/recent-entries.ts` was loading every entry in the workspace into memory with
 * no filter/bound at all, then sorting/slicing in JS, violating SPEC-043 REQ-25's "one bounded
 * query, no unbounded scans" resolver contract). All three are optional and additive — every
 * existing caller that omits them keeps identical behavior.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/entries` domain logic. Depends only on this package's own `types.ts`.

   * general rather than baking in the one call shape the current screen needs). `status`/`orderBy`/
   * `limit` are pushed down into the query itself (not applied client-side after a full scan) by
