/**
 * @file The one and only module in this repository that touches a real headless browser.
 * Implements `SiteEvidenceBrowserPort` (`browser-port.ts`) on Playwright's Chromium.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why the import is dynamic, and why the module's types are declared here
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * `playwright` is a real runtime dependency of this package (`package.json`), but the BROWSER
 * BINARY it drives is not installed by `npm install` — it needs a separate `playwright install
 * chromium` step, which the production image runs and a bare `npm ci` does not. So both halves can
 * legitimately be missing at runtime, independently:
 *
 * - the module itself, on a deployment that pruned it;
 * - the Chromium binary, on a deployment that installed the module but not the browser.
 *
 * Both are caught here and converted into `{ available: false, reason }`, never a thrown error and
 * never a boot failure. The tool then reports "no browser in this deployment" and the compliance
 * skill is required by its own output contract to downgrade every rendered-truth finding to
 * `cannot-determine`. That is the entire reason this adapter must not be a static import: a static
 * one would make an optional capability a hard boot dependency for every Tovu install.
 *
 * {@link PlaywrightLike} declares, structurally, exactly the eight or so members this adapter uses.
 * That is deliberate rather than importing Playwright's own (very large) `.d.ts`: typechecking this
 * repository must not depend on a browser automation library's type surface being resolvable, and
 * naming the members used makes the actual coupling one short, reviewable block instead of an
 * open-ended import.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Privacy properties, enforced here rather than promised
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * - **Ephemeral context.** `browser.newContext()` with no `storageState` and no user-data
 *   directory. Cookies, storage, and cache exist only in memory and die with `close()`. Nothing is
 *   written to disk by this module.
 * - **One context per page.** Each `observe()` call gets a fresh context, so a cookie set by page A
 *   can never be reported as though page B set it — which would be an outright false citation in a
 *   pre-consent cookie finding.
 * - **No non-GET request ever leaves the process.** Every request is intercepted; anything that is
 *   not GET or HEAD is aborted and recorded as blocked. This is what makes "never submits forms" a
 *   structural property instead of a policy: even if a page auto-submits, or a consent widget POSTs
 *   preferences, the attempt is observed and the bytes do not go out.
 * - **Values are never read.** Cookie values, request bodies, and form-field values are not
 *   extracted anywhere below, because `browser-port.ts`'s shapes have nowhere to put them.

/**
 * Builds the self-contained JavaScript expression that runs `collectPageStructure` inside the page.

 * **Why not just `page.evaluate(collectPageStructure, limits)`.** That was the obvious first
 * implementation and it fails at runtime, in the browser, with `ReferenceError: __name is not
 * defined` — found by this feature's real-browser integration test, and invisible to every
 * fake-browser test and to `tsc`. The cause: esbuild (which `tsx` uses, and which any bundler with
 * `keepNames` enabled uses) rewrites nested function declarations as
 * `var f = __name(function f() {...}, "f")` and emits `__name` as a MODULE-scope helper. Playwright
 * serialises only the function's own source text, so the helper it now depends on is left behind on
 * the Node side and the page hits an undefined identifier.
 *
 * The fix is to ship a one-line `__name` shim into the page alongside the function source, inside an
 * IIFE so both stay out of the page's own global scope. That makes the evaluated code genuinely
 * self-contained — which is what `page-structure-script.ts`'s header already claims, and now
 * actually is under every transpiler this repo runs through.
 *
 * `limits` is embedded as a JSON literal rather than passed as an argument for the same reason:
 * one string, no second serialization path that could behave differently.
