/**
 * @file SPEC-018 C-207 / REQ-15 / REQ-15a / REQ-16 / INV-06 / INV-08 — `mergeTerm`'s gated-mutation
 * instantiation via `core/gated-mutations`.
 *
 * This suite tests only this domain's OWN wrapping logic (the self-merge guard REQ-15a, and the
 * plan's overlap-loss disclosure REQ-16) — the plan/confirm/execute ordering itself, token TTL,
 * and actor-class rule are SPEC-016's own certified contract (see
 * `src/core/gated-mutations/__tests__/unit/gateway.unit.test.ts`), consumed here via a fake
 * `core/gated-mutations.plan()` seam, not re-tested.
 *
 * Assumed seam design:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export class SameTermMergeError extends Error {}
 *
 * export async function planMergeTerm(
 *   required: {
 *     principalId: string; principalKind: "user" | "agent" | "api_key";
 *     fromTermId: string; intoTermId: string;
 *     computeOverlap: () => Promise<{ overlappingContentCount: number }>;
 *     gatewayPlan: (details: unknown) => Promise<{ planId: string; planHash: string; details: unknown }>;
 *   },
 *   optional?: {}
 * ): Promise<{ planId: string; planHash: string; details: { overlapLossDisclosed: boolean; overlappingContentCount: number } }>;
 * // throws SameTermMergeError if fromTermId === intoTermId, BEFORE computeOverlap is ever called
 * ```
