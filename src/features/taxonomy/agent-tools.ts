/**
 * @file The Taxonomy agent-tool catalog (SPEC-018/ADR-044) — this domain's instance of the
 * per-domain `agent-tools.ts` convention `features/content-types/agent-tools.ts`,
 * `features/database/agent-tools.ts`, and every other domain catalog already use (ADR-049
 * Decision 4).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * A static, in-process catalog describing every agent-callable tool this domain exposes. Every
 * WRITE entry maps 1:1 onto a real exported function of `features/taxonomy/write-service.ts`
 * (`createTaxonomy`, `createTerm`, `renameTerm`, `assignTerms`); the one read maps onto
 * `features/taxonomy/list.ts`'s `listTaxonomiesWithTerms`.
 *
 * `mergeTerm` (SPEC-018 C-207, `merge-term.ts`) — read carefully, treated with the same scrutiny
 * Database's `migrate-forward` and Recovery's `restore` ceremonies got:
 * Merge is destructive and can silently lose pre-merge `entry_terms` assignment history for content
 * already assigned to both terms (`merge-term.ts`'s own file header: "ADR-044's 'Destructive term
 * merge' failure mode"). That is why it alone, of every taxonomy mutation, gets a plan/confirm/
 * execute ceremony through `core/gated-mutations` rather than an ordinary authorize-then-write.
 * Reading `core/gated-mutations/gateway.ts` directly settles what is and is not safe to hand an
 * agent:
 *   - `plan()` "Never invokes `hooks.executeMutation()` — a plan is read-only by construction
 *     (AC-10)" (`gateway.ts`'s own doc comment). It authorizes `admin.taxonomy.manage`, recomputes
 *     the live overlap-loss disclosure, and returns a plan. Persists nothing. Safe to wire as a
 *     READ, mirroring `features/database/agent-tools.ts`'s identical `database_plan_migrate_forward`
 *     precedent (same file's own comment: "the step that actually redeems a plan into a mutation
 *     (confirm()) can never be reached by an agent principal at all").
 *   - `confirm()` structurally refuses an agent: `gateway.ts`'s own body — "if (principalKind ===
 *     'agent') throw new ForbiddenError('agent principals may not confirm a gated mutation', ...)"
 *     — before any permission check even runs. No `taxonomy_confirm_merge_term`-equivalent tool
 *     exists in this catalog, and no description below may even imply that step (mirrors
 *     `features/recovery/agent-tools.ts`'s own INV-06 discipline for `backup_execute_restore`: "the
 *     human confirmation step is exactly the one act SPEC-016's gateway reserves for kind='user'/
 *     api_key principals").
 *   - `execute()` needs a confirmation token a human already minted through the admin UI's own
 *     ceremony (`server/routes/admin/taxonomy/merge-term.ts`'s `/merge/confirm` route) — the same
 *     `confirmer-must-equal-own-delegatedBy` actor-class rule `database_execute_migrate_forward`/
 *     `backup_execute_restore` carry, which `assistant/tool-registration-kit.ts`'s
 *     `ACTOR_CLASS_RULES_REQUIRING_CONFIRMATION_TRANSPORT` refuses to build regardless of this
 *     catalog's own choice, because Tovu's `ToolExecutor` has no confirmation transport wired.
 *     `taxonomy_execute_merge_term` is declared here (so the exclusion is a structural build-time
 *     refusal, not just an absent handler) but is NEVER wired by `tool-registrations.ts`.
 *
 * Naming: `taxonomy_*`, matching this package's own name — distinct from `features/content-types`'
 * `collections_*` prefix (a different ADR-043 pairing) and from `features/entries`' own
 * `collections_entry_*` prefix.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * `features/taxonomy/tool-registrations.ts` maps these entries into `@jini-ai/core`
 * `ToolRegistration`s.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/taxonomy` domain declaration. Imports only `TAXONOMY_ALLOWED_CONTENT_TYPES` from its
 * own `write-service.ts`, so the published `contentType` enum cannot drift from what the domain
 * actually accepts.
