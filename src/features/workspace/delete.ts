/**
 * @file `DELETE_WORKSPACE` (SPEC-044 REQ-05/INV-03) — hard-delete a workspace, guarded so the
 * install is never left with zero workspace rows.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Because a v1 install always has exactly one workspace row (SPEC-044's Architectural Finding —
 * `RouteDeps.workspaceId` is fixed at process composition, so no request can ever address a second,
 * even-if-present workspace row today), `deleteWorkspace` **always refuses in v1**. That is correct,
 * guarded behavior, not a stub: the precondition, the atomicity, and the typed refusal all exist and
 * are exercised by tests now, so the day a second, genuinely addressable workspace exists, delete
 * works without further design (see feature.spec.md REQ-05's own text).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Ordinary slice function (ADR-006) — not a port. `deps.repo.list()` is the count source; the guard
 * check and the delete happen inside one `async` function body with no `await` yielded to another
 * caller in between the count read and the delete write, which — in this codebase's single Node.js
 * event-loop, no-concurrent-DB-transaction execution model (the same "atomic by construction"
 * reasoning `identity/grant-service.ts`'s own header comment documents for its transitions, and the
 * same model `DISABLE_PRINCIPAL`'s INV-08 count-check-then-disable already relies on) — is the
 * atomicity INV-03 requires. A future multi-process/multi-connection deployment would need a real
 * DB-level transaction here; flagged, not silently assumed away.

 * rejection.
 *
 * @complexity O(n) in the total workspace count (`repo.list()`) — bounded by the same
 * operator-managed-roster assumption `identity`'s `PrincipalRepoPort.list()` already makes; not a
