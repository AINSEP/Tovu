/**
 * @file The blob content-type store — what lets the admin Media screen's "Images"/"Videos" tabs
 * filter by asset type.
 *
 * Why this is a Tovu-owned port rather than a field on an existing one: `uploadMedia` and the
 * `AssetBlobRepoPort`/`MediaRepoPort` contracts live in `@jini-ai/cms` (a separate package and
 * repo). `uploadMedia` validates the client's declared `contentType` string against an advisory
 * allowlist and then DISCARDS it, and neither `AssetBlobRecord` nor `MediaRecord` has a field to
 * carry one. Threading a type through those frozen records would be an upstream change; this
 * narrow side port keeps the whole fix inside this host, and — because it is its own port — it
 * gets both a real adapter and an in-memory double, so it works against `server/deps.ts`'s SQLite
 * composition root AND `server/app.ts`'s hermetic in-memory one.
 *
 * Keyed by `(workspaceId, sha256)`, not by media id, because the content type is a property of the
 * BYTES. That is also why blob dedup makes this free: two library entries that share one blob
 * share one recorded type.
 *
 * The stored value is always `sniffContentType(bytes)` — the real magic-byte answer — never the
 * client's upload-time string. `routes/admin/media/original.ts`'s file header already establishes
 * that invariant for the byte-serving route ("`Content-Type` is NEVER the client's upload-time
 * string"); recording the declared string here instead would let an operator's "Images" tab
 * disagree with the `Content-Type` their browser is actually served, which is the same
 * attacker-controlled-string trust this system deliberately refuses everywhere else.
 *
 * A recorded value is therefore never absent-because-unknown: an unrecognized blob records the
 * sniffer's own `"application/octet-stream"`, a real answer. A MISSING entry means only "not
 * sniffed yet" — a blob written before this store existed. Because the value is a pure function of
 * bytes this system already stores, a missing entry is always recoverable by re-sniffing rather
 * than lost, which is what makes the read-path backfill in `routes/admin/media/list.ts` exact
 * rather than a guess.
