/**
 * @file ADR-023 §3 (T4 fix) — disk-headroom preflight. Before any snapshot, core computes
 * `required = 1.5 x (current DB file size + WAL file size)`. If free disk space on the volume
 * holding `content.db` is below that, the dataModule operation fails closed before any file is
 * touched.
 *
 * Disclosed limitation: `fs.statfsSync` (Node 18.15+/20.4+) is used to read free space. If it is
 * unavailable on the running platform/Node version, this is a MEASUREMENT failure, not a
 * headroom-insufficiency finding — the check logs a warning and reports `ok: true` (proceeds)
 * rather than failing closed on an unrelated platform gap. Failing closed is reserved for a
 * genuine, measured insufficiency.

  // headroom requirement to preflight — the check is not just redundant but potentially WRONG
  // without this guard: `path.dirname(":memory:")` resolves to the process's CURRENT WORKING
  // DIRECTORY, so a low-disk cwd could fail-close a dataModule declare that will never touch disk
  // at all. `requiredBytes: 0` mirrors the existing "nonexistent file" case below (real dbPath,
  // file not yet created) rather than inventing a new shape for callers to handle.
