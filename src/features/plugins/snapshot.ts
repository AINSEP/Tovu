/**
 * @file SPIKE — whole-file snapshot before a schema change (ADR-023 §4, §11).
 *
 * The never-brick reversibility anchor: core takes a whole-file snapshot via SQLite's ONLINE
 * BACKUP API (not a raw `fs` copy — the backup API is WAL-safe on a live db) before ANY plugin
 * DDL. If the change fails, the snapshot is the named recovery point (§9). Copy-on-write
 * shadow-tables are a deferred >~1GB optimization (§11), not this.
 *
 * BUG FIX (2026-07-28): for an in-memory (or SQLite's other non-file) `dbPath`, this function is a
 * no-op that returns `null` instead of attempting a file backup. This is NOT a weakened guarantee —
 * it's recognizing the guarantee doesn't apply. §4's whole doctrine is "next-boot recovery from a
 * crash" (see `data-module.ts`'s file header and `migration-recovery.ts`): for `:memory:`, there is
 * no "next boot" — the database is discarded in full the instant the process ends, whether or not a
 * snapshot exists. Before this fix, `path.dirname(":memory:")` resolved to `"."` (the process's
 * current working directory) and `path.basename(":memory:")` resolved to the literal string
 * `":memory:"`, so every call against an in-memory test db (used pervasively by this repo's test
 * suite, e.g. `src/newsletter/__tests__/repo.contract.test.ts` via `openContentDb(":memory:")`)
 * wrote a REAL, non-empty SQLite backup file literally named `:memory:.snapshot-<label>-<ts>` into
 * the repo root — hundreds of MB accumulated across a single session's test runs.

/**
 * True when `dbPath` is one of SQLite's special non-file identifiers rather than a real path on
 * disk, for any of which `path.dirname`/`path.basename` produce meaningless fragments:
 *  - the literal `:memory:` identifier (an anonymous, process-private in-memory database);
 *  - the empty string `""` (SQLite's OTHER special identifier — an anonymous, private on-disk temp
 *    database deleted when the connection closes; like `:memory:` it never has a stable path to
 *    snapshot to or restore from, so it gets the same no-op treatment);
 *  - a `file:` URI naming the same thing via SQLite's URI-filename syntax — either the path
 *    component is itself the `:memory:` token (e.g. `file::memory:?cache=shared`, the form SQLite's
 *    own docs use) or the query string sets `mode=memory` explicitly (e.g. `file:x?mode=memory`).
 * See sqlite.org/inmemorydb.html and sqlite.org/uri.html.
