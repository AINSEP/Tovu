/**
 * @file The lipay payments-framework contracts (architecture review §4/§5).
 *
 * lipay is the payments FRAMEWORK plugin — the role WooCommerce itself plays, not the role one
 * gateway plays. Concrete gateways (the first-party `lipay` gateway in `providers/lipay-gateway.ts`,
 * and later Stripe/PayPal/regional systems) are `PaymentProvider` implementations registered into
 * it. Core never enumerates them.
 *
 * Three properties this file exists to make true, each traced to a failure in the systems the
 * architecture review studied:
 *   - `PaymentProviderId` is an OPEN string, not a closed union. Open SaaS's
 *     `id: "stripe" | "lemonsqueezy" | "polar"` (and this repo's own `DeployTarget`) make every new
 *     provider a core edit; Open SaaS's Paddle PR has to patch `| "paddle"` into the interface file.
 *   - Capabilities are a TYPED OBJECT, not WooCommerce's flat string array. WooCommerce's
 *     `$supports` is the mechanism that let a 2011 cheque gateway and a 2026 tokenizing card
 *     gateway coexist for 15 years; its untyped execution means a typo silently hides a button and
 *     partial support ("refunds, but only in full") is inexpressible.
 *   - `createCharge` returns THREE separate facts — did the call succeed (`ok`), did money move
 *     (`status`), what must the shopper do (`next`). WooCommerce collapsed all three into one
 *     string, where `'success'` for an off-site gateway means only "I produced a URL"; its own
 *     Store API later had to reintroduce `pending` as a fourth status to say what that really was.
 *
 * Discipline every implementation inherits from `deploy-plugin.ts` and may not break: no method
 * throws (every failure is a typed `PaymentError`), no method touches the database (core owns all
 * persistence and all idempotency), and all outbound HTTP goes through `ctx.httpClient` — the one
 * guarded ADR-038 seam — never a raw `fetch`.
