/**
 * @file The core-mediated plugin dataModule engine (ADR-023 §2/§3/§4/§5/§6/§9).
 *
 * A plugin DECLARES its desired tables as data; CORE alone executes the DDL. A plugin never
 * authors a migration and never holds a raw DB handle. The flow, in order:
 *   1. validate the declaration (namespace `p_{pluginId}__*` §5, column shape, tier §3/T6) —
 *      before any I/O;
 *   2. skip tables that already exist (idempotent, state-based reconciliation §2);
 *   3. disk-headroom preflight (§3/T4) — fails closed before any file is touched;
 *   4. namespace-adoption guard (§5/§6/T5) — fails closed on an unresolved provenance mismatch;
 *   5. **snapshot the whole db FIRST** (§4) — the never-brick anchor;
 *   6. open a durable phase-journal entry (§2/T3);
 *   7. run all DDL, the post-DDL verification, AND the journal's own COMMITTED transition inside
 *      ONE transaction (see this file's POST-COMMIT DATA-LOSS WINDOW section for why verification
 *      and the journal write are in-transaction too, not just the DDL) so a failure rolls the live
 *      db AND the journal back together to a working, truthfully-recorded state (§9: recoverable,
 *      not zero-loss) — SQLite's own transaction rollback handles this same-process, non-crash
 *      case; the snapshot/journal exist for the CRASH case, recovered at next boot by
 *      `migration-recovery.ts` (see that file and `restore.ts` for why restore only ever runs
 *      there, never live).
 *
 * IN-MEMORY `dbPath` (BUG FIX, 2026-07-28): steps 3, 5, and 6 above are conditionally skipped for an
 * in-memory (or SQLite's other non-file) `dbPath` — see `snapshot.ts`'s `isInMemoryDbPath`. Disk
 * headroom (step 3, via `disk-headroom.ts`) and the whole snapshot/journal apparatus (steps 5-6)
 * exist specifically to make "recovery at next boot" possible; for `:memory:` there IS no next
 * boot — the database is discarded in full the instant the process ends, so "recoverable" and
 * "not recoverable" are the same outcome regardless of whether a snapshot/journal entry exists.
 * Skipping them for this case isn't a weakened guarantee, it's recognizing the guarantee doesn't
 * apply. Step 7's same-process transaction rollback is UNAFFECTED and remains the full safety net
 * for an in-memory db, because it is the only failure mode that can ever occur for one (there is no
 * separate process to crash-and-restart into that could observe a different, corrupted state).
 *
 * COLUMN-LEVEL RECONCILIATION (BUG FIX, 2026-08-12): §2's own text is "Core diffs declared-state
 * against live-state and executes the DDL itself" — but the first implementation of step 2 only
 * diffed *table names*, not table *contents*. A plugin whose v2 manifest added a column to an
 * already-existing table got `{ ok: true, created: [] }` back — the table-name presence check saw
 * the table, concluded there was nothing to do, and took the early no-op path — and the new column
 * silently never existed. The failure then surfaced far from its cause: at query time, against
 * whatever repository call first touched the missing column, with no link back to the manifest
 * that declared it. Step 2 now diffs declared columns against `PRAGMA table_info` for every table
 * that already exists, not just the table's name. A declared-but-missing column on an existing
 * table has three possible outcomes: (a) a plain nullable, non-PRIMARY-KEY column is safely
 * addable via `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` and gets queued as an alteration; (b) a `NOT NULL` column
 * cannot — SQLite refuses `ADD COLUMN` with a `NOT NULL` constraint unless a non-NULL default is
 * also supplied, and this declaration grammar (`ColumnDecl`) has no default field to supply one,
 * so this fails closed with `COLUMN_ADD_NOT_NULL_WITHOUT_DEFAULT`; (c) a `PRIMARY KEY` column can
 * never be added to an existing table via `ALTER TABLE` at all — SQLite has no such statement,
 * only a full create-copy-drop-rename table rebuild, which is a materially larger and riskier
 * change than this fix and stays explicitly out of scope — so this fails closed with
 * `COLUMN_ADD_PRIMARY_KEY`. A live column whose type no longer matches its declaration also fails
 * closed (`COLUMN_TYPE_MISMATCH`) for the same reason: a type change is a rebuild, not an `ALTER`.
 *
 * CONSTRAINT-LEVEL RECONCILIATION (BUG FIX, 2026-08-12): the reconciliation above diffed an
 * existing column's `type` but not its `notNull`/`primaryKey` declarations — a plugin author
 * tightening either constraint on an already-existing column (e.g. a v2 manifest marking a
 * previously-nullable column `notNull: true`) got `{ ok: true, altered: [] }` back with the live
 * column completely unchanged: the identical silent-non-enforcement bug class the type-mismatch
 * fix above closed, just for two different fields on the same struct. `assertColumnNotNullMatches`
 * and `assertColumnPrimaryKeyMatches` now run alongside `assertColumnTypeMatches` for every
 * existing column a declaration mentions, each failing closed (`COLUMN_NOT_NULL_MISMATCH` /
 * `COLUMN_PRIMARY_KEY_MISMATCH`) on disagreement, for the same reason as the type case: SQLite's
 * `ALTER TABLE` cannot change either constraint on an existing column — no `ALTER COLUMN`, no way
 * to add or drop a `NOT NULL` or `PRIMARY KEY` short of the same create-copy-drop-rename rebuild
 * this file stays out of scope of everywhere else.
 *
 * Both checks are DIRECTION-AGNOSTIC — declared-stricter-than-live and declared-looser-than-live
 * both fail closed — deliberately mirroring `COLUMN_TYPE_MISMATCH`'s own symmetric behavior rather
 * than only catching the tightening direction the bug report above led with. The two directions
 * are not equally *dangerous* (tightening risks silent bad data creeping in past a constraint the
 * app believes SQLite is enforcing; loosening at most risks a write later hitting a live
 * constraint the current manifest doesn't mention, which SQLite itself rejects loudly at write
 * time, not silently) — but both are still a manifest that disagrees with the database it
 * describes, and this module's whole job is to surface that disagreement at `declare()` time,
 * next to the manifest, rather than let either direction surface later at some unrelated write
 * site with no link back to the manifest. `COLUMN_TYPE_MISMATCH` never special-cased "safe"
 * directions either (e.g. widening `INTEGER` to `REAL` isn't unsafe the way `TEXT`→`INTEGER` is)
 * for the same underlying reason, so this stays consistent with the established fail-closed
 * default rather than inventing a narrower rule for these two fields alone.
 *
 * `assertColumnPrimaryKeyMatches` compares against `getExistingColumns`'s already-boolean
 * `primaryKey` field (`pk !== 0`, not `pk === 1`) so a column that is part of a *composite*
 * primary key (`PRAGMA table_info`'s `pk` is an ordinal position, 1-based, not a 0/1 flag) is
 * still read correctly as "is a primary key column" rather than only the first component
 * matching. Whether that scenario can even arise given this engine's own DDL is a separate
 * question: `ColumnDecl.primaryKey` is a single-column boolean with no table-level composite-key
 * grammar, and `CREATE TABLE` with two columns each carrying a column-level `PRIMARY KEY`
 * constraint is rejected by SQLite itself ("table has more than one primary key") before this
 * code ever runs — so this engine cannot *create* a composite-PK table through its own DDL. A
 * live table could still carry one from outside this engine's DDL entirely (the §0 access-control
 * caveat below: a Tier-3 plugin holding a raw handle, or a table that predates this engine) — the
 * ordinal-aware read guards against exactly that case rather than assuming it can't happen.
 *
 * A live column the CURRENT declaration no longer mentions is deliberately left alone rather than
 * dropped — this engine never authors a `DROP COLUMN` on a plugin's behalf; an operator who rolled
 * a plugin back to an older manifest, or a manifest that stopped mentioning a column on purpose,
 * should not lose that column's data to a silent, unrequested `DROP`. When an existing table needs
 * one or more columns added, the full snapshot/journal/single-transaction apparatus below still
 * runs for it exactly as it does for a brand-new table — only the fully-reconciled no-op case
 * (every declared table exists with every declared column already present and matching) skips it.
 *
 * INDEX-LEVEL RECONCILIATION (BUG FIX, 2026-08-12): the column-level reconciliation above still
 * built `toAlter` from `columnsToAdd` alone — a declared `IndexDecl` on an already-existing table
 * was reconciled only on the CREATE path (`table.indexes` was only ever walked inside the
 * `plan.toCreate` loop), so a v2 manifest that added an index to an existing table got
 * `{ ok: true, altered: [...] }` back (truthfully reporting the column work, if any) with the
 * index itself silently never created — the identical bug class one level up. `getExistingIndexes`
 * reads `fqTableName`'s live indexes via `PRAGMA index_list` + `PRAGMA index_info`, filtered to
 * `origin: 'c'` rows only: SQLite also auto-creates an implicit index per `UNIQUE` column
 * constraint (`origin: 'u'`) and one for most `PRIMARY KEY` shapes (`origin: 'pk'`, e.g.
 * `sqlite_autoindex_*`), neither of which was ever declared through `IndexDecl` or created by this
 * module's own `indexSql` — diffing against those would be comparing against something the
 * declaration grammar can't even express. `planIndexReconciliation` then diffs declared indexes
 * (matched by the SAME generated name `indexSql` already uses to create one) against that live
 * set: a declared index missing live is queued in `indexesToAdd`, safely creatable via a plain
 * `CREATE INDEX` — unlike the column NOT NULL/PRIMARY KEY cases above, an index carries no data
 * for `ALTER` semantics to conflict with, so there is no "SQLite literally cannot express this"
 * case here to fail closed on. A declared index whose live shape (column list, in order, or
 * uniqueness) no longer matches is queued in `indexesToRecreate` (`DROP INDEX` then `CREATE INDEX`,
 * both inside this call's single transaction, so a mid-way failure rolls back exactly like any
 * other DDL here) — a deliberate choice, not an oversight: an index is pure derived structure with
 * no data of its own, so dropping and rebuilding it risks nothing a rollback wouldn't already
 * protect, in sharp contrast to a column whose type/constraint this file explicitly refuses to
 * touch because doing so risks the column's actual data. The one way this CAN still fail is a
 * `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` rejected by genuine live duplicate values — that surfaces exactly like any
 * other DDL failure in this transaction (rollback, `DDL_FAILED`, snapshot kept as the recovery
 * point), needing no special-casing. A live index the CURRENT declaration no longer mentions is
 * left alone, mirroring the column-drop policy directly above. `assertIdentifierFits` already
 * covers every declared index's generated name unconditionally, for both the create and alter
 * paths — `validate()` walks `table.indexes` for every table in the declaration up front, before
 * reconciliation ever runs, so no separate length check is needed in this new path.
 *
 * POST-COMMIT JOURNAL INTEGRITY (BUG FIX, 2026-08-12): the catch block below used to write
 * `ROLLED_BACK` unconditionally on ANY failure inside the DDL try block — but a failure can occur
 * either BEFORE the `db.transaction()` call resolves (SQLite's own rollback truly undid every
 * write; `ROLLED_BACK` is accurate) or AFTER it already committed (`verifyPostDdl` throwing, or
 * even the `advancePhaseIfJournaled(..., "COMMITTED")` write itself throwing) — and for that second
 * case, the DDL is live and durable, so `ROLLED_BACK` was a lie: the journal claimed a rollback
 * that never happened. `migration-recovery.ts` only ever restores NON-terminal entries
 * (`ROLLED_BACK`/`COMMITTED` are both terminal, see `migration-journal.ts`'s `TERMINAL_PHASES`), so
 * a next-boot crash recovery would see this mislabeled entry, conclude there is nothing to do, and
 * skip it — leaving the live db and the journal's account of it permanently disagreeing, with
 * nothing left to ever reconcile them. `declareDataModule` now tracks `transactionCommitted`,
 * flipped to `true` the instant `db.transaction(() => { ... })()` returns without throwing, and
 * `recordFailurePhase` uses it to decide: pre-commit, write `ROLLED_BACK` as before (truthful,
 * unchanged); post-commit, write NOTHING and leave the journal at whatever non-terminal phase it
 * already reached (`VERIFYING`, set immediately after the transaction resolves, before either of
 * the two post-commit throw sites) — non-terminal is exactly what makes next-boot recovery pick it
 * up and restore from the pre-DDL snapshot. **CORRECTED below, same day**: leaving a non-terminal
 * phase behind turned out to trade one bug for a worse one — see POST-COMMIT DATA-LOSS WINDOW
 * immediately following this section for why "restore from the pre-DDL snapshot" is NOT the correct
 * outcome for this case, and what replaced `transactionCommitted`/`recordFailurePhase` instead.
 *
 * POST-COMMIT DATA-LOSS WINDOW (BUG FIX, 2026-08-12, same-day follow-up to the fix immediately
 * above): the fix above stopped LYING about a post-commit failure, but stopping the lie did not
 * stop the underlying failure from existing. A post-commit `verifyPostDdl` failure correctly wrote
 * nothing and left the entry at `VERIFYING` — but `VERIFYING` is non-terminal, and
 * `migration-recovery.ts` treats every non-terminal entry as a crash-interrupted attempt requiring
 * restore, indistinguishably from an actual process crash. The scenario this opened: DDL commits,
 * verification fails (a normal, catchable, in-process failure — the process does NOT crash),
 * `declareDataModule` returns `{ ok: false }`, and the site keeps running and serving traffic —
 * nothing about a caught, in-process exception stops that. Every write the site accepts from that
 * moment on, by ANY table, not just this plugin's, is exposed: the recovery snapshot is a
 * WHOLE-FILE backup (§4), and `restoreFromSnapshot` (`restore.ts`) is a whole-file copy back over
 * `dbPath`. The next time anything restarts the process — an operator's routine deploy, not a
 * crash — boot-time `recoverIncompleteDataModuleMigrations` finds the still-`VERIFYING` entry,
 * restores the whole db file to its pre-DDL state, and every write since is gone, with no crash and
 * no operator warning to explain why. Direct reproduction (both as a fault-injected `:memory:` case
 * and as a full write-after-failure/restart/verify-survival end-to-end case, see
 * `data-module.test.ts`) confirmed both the live-column retention AND the eventual data loss on
 * recovery; this was not a hypothetical.
 *
 * The root cause both this fix and the one above were reacting to is the same: `verifyPostDdl` ran
 * AFTER `db.transaction()` had already committed, so there was always going to be SOME failure mode
 * in that gap that a post-hoc phase label could describe accurately but never close. The actual fix
 * is to remove the gap: `verifyPostDdl` now runs as the LAST statement INSIDE the same
 * `db.transaction()` that runs the DDL, and a failure throws from inside that callback — the exact
 * same mechanism `applyTableCreate`/`applyTableAlteration` already use to fail the transaction, so
 * better-sqlite3's own automatic `ROLLBACK` undoes the DDL right along with it. There is no longer a
 * state where the DDL is live but unverified; verified-and-committed and rolled-back-entirely are
 * now the only two reachable outcomes. (Verification's own `PRAGMA table_info`/`index_list` reads
 * are unaffected by running mid-transaction — a SQLite connection sees its own uncommitted writes
 * within the same transaction exactly like committed ones, confirmed directly for this repo's
 * better-sqlite3 build; it is not merely inferred from general SQL semantics.)
 *
 * The journal's own `COMMITTED` transition moves inside the same transaction too, via
 * `migration-journal.ts`'s `stageJournalPhase` — a checkpoint-free write, because
 * `advanceJournalPhase` CANNOT be reused here: it calls `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(FULL)`, and a
 * checkpoint issued by the SAME connection that holds an open write transaction throws `database
 * table is locked` (confirmed directly, not assumed — SQLite's own docs do not call out
 * same-connection mid-transaction checkpoint behavior at all, so this needed a real probe, not a
 * reading). Writing `COMMITTED` inside the DDL transaction means a crash at the worst possible
 * instant — literally between SQLite's internal commit and this function's `db.transaction()` call
 * returning to JS — still leaves the journal reading `COMMITTED`, because that write committed WITH
 * the DDL, as one indivisible unit; there is no instant at which live state and journal state can
 * disagree. `stagePhaseIfJournaled` no-ops for the in-memory case exactly like
 * `advancePhaseIfJournaled` does, matching this file's existing in-memory convention throughout.
 *
 * `declareDataModule`'s catch block goes back to unconditionally writing `ROLLED_BACK` — the
 * `transactionCommitted` flag and `recordFailurePhase`'s pre/post-commit fork the previous fix
 * introduced are gone, not because that reasoning was wrong but because it is now unreachable: with
 * verification and the `COMMITTED` write both inside the transaction, `db.transaction()` throwing
 * means SQLite really did roll everything back in every remaining case, so `ROLLED_BACK` is once
 * again always truthful — the same simplicity the very first version of this file had, restored
 * without reintroducing the bug that simplicity originally hid. The one sliver of risk that
 * remains — the belt-and-suspenders `advancePhaseIfJournaled(db, journalId, "COMMITTED")` checkpoint
 * call (re-writing the already-`COMMITTED` row purely to force its WAL merge), or
 * `discardSnapshotIfFileBacked`, throwing AFTER the transaction has already committed everything
 * that matters — is deliberately kept OUT of the catch path entirely: both calls run in their own
 * swallow-all block after the transaction succeeds, because by that point the migration is already
 * correct and durable, and reporting `{ ok: false }` for a housekeeping hiccup would itself be a lie
 * in the other direction (the same principle `discardCommittedSnapshot` already documents: "must
 * not turn a successful migration into a reported failure").
 *
 * T2 (§4's exclusive cross-process lock) is DELIBERATELY NOT acquired here — SPEC-033 correction
 * (2026-07-16), superseding SPEC-032's original implementation. The ADR's own §4 text scopes T2's
 * purpose narrowly: "The SQLite online backup API is safe under concurrent writers during
 * snapshot creation — that step needs no change here. Restore is a different, less-safe
 * operation" — the lock exists to guard RESTORE, not the live snapshot+DDL window. `restore.ts`'s
 * own header already establishes that restore never runs live in this codebase's actual topology
 * (single-process, single long-lived connection; restore only runs at boot-time recovery, before
 * any other connection exists) — so T2's stated danger literally cannot occur here. Holding a
 * real `PRAGMA locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE` during the live window instead caused a genuine,
 * deterministic production bug: a live multi-boot smoke test against the real server found the
 * store plugin's own separate `content.db` connection (`store-plugin.ts#bootstrapStore`) failing
 * boot with "database is locked" every time, confirmed via A/B testing (disabling the lock calls
 * made the failure disappear immediately) — the exact interleaving mechanism was not fully
 * root-caused (multiple fire-and-forget dataModule declares and other writers share one
 * long-lived connection in the real composition, unlike any isolated repro), but the causal link
 * to `locking_mode=EXCLUSIVE` was empirically conclusive. Removing an unneeded lock whose own
 * ADR-stated justification doesn't apply here, rather than debugging a specific interleaving
 * further, is the correct call.
 *
 * ADR-023 is ACCEPTED (2026-07-11) after a 3-round external audit whose T1-T8 findings are now
 * ALL reflected in code across this file, `migration-journal.ts`, `disk-headroom.ts`,
 * `plugin-identity.ts`, `migration-recovery.ts`, and `restore.ts` — see SPEC-032/SPEC-033 for the
 * full record of which finding lives where. This engine exists ahead of §12's "v1 ships seams
 * only" schedule: §12's own last line permits shipping it early "against a concrete demand
 * plugin," and Newsletter (`src/newsletter/data-module-manifest.ts`) is exactly that — a real
 * production consumer already calling this engine before this file's safety mechanics existed.
 *
 * NOTE (§0 access-control caveat): a Tier-3 in-process plugin could bypass this by opening the db
 * file directly. The RECOVERABILITY guarantee here (who snapshots + who runs DDL = core) holds
 * unconditionally for core-mediated DDL; the access-control framing is advisory until ADR-024 §4
 * Rung 2 (capability sandbox) ships — see ADR-023 §0 for the full, precise wording.
