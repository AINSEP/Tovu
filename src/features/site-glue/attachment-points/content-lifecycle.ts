/**
 * @file `attachGlueContentLifecycle()` — the content-lifecycle attachment point (SPEC-048 REQ-5;
 * ADR-057 Decision 2's `content.entry.beforeSave` adapter row, Decision 2.1).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The wired adapter for the one category that stays **fail-closed, unchanged** (ADR-057 Decision 4
 * — data-mutation call sites are never fail-isolated). This module owns none of that containment
 * logic itself: it delegates straight to {@link GlueHostPort.attachContentLifecycleFilter}, whose
 * real, host-specific implementation is expected to attach the given filter to a live
 * `hook-registry.ts` instance via `plugin-runtime/loader.ts`'s `attachLoadedPlugin()` — the shared
 * extraction ADR-057 Decision 2.1 introduced, with the `"glue"` source. That composition (a real
 * `HookRegistry` plus `attachLoadedPlugin`) is host-specific wiring and does not belong in this
 * product-neutral module; see `__tests__/integration/content-lifecycle.integration.test.ts` for a
 * worked example proving the two compose correctly end to end.
 *
 * Product-neutral core: depends only on `../ports` (the frozen `GlueHostPort` seam). No import of
 * `plugin-runtime`, `hook-registry.ts`, or anything else host-specific — the fail-closed
 * *mechanism* this category relies on lives entirely behind the port, not in this file.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Implementation Outline slice 2 (ADR-057, Implementation Outline). Depends on slice 1's frozen
 * `manifest.ts`/`ports.ts` contracts.
