/**
 * @file Database's `GatedMutationHooks` factory for the `migrate-forward` ceremony (SPEC-017
 * C-103/C-105) — the domain-specific quarter of what used to be
 * `server/gated-mutations-composition.ts`, split out so Database no longer needs a back-edge into
 * `server/` for its own hook builder. The generic pieces every ceremony shares (`buildGatewayDeps`,
 * `planHashOf`, `resolveActorClassIdentity`, `buildConfirmOnlyHooks`) stayed in
 * `core/gated-mutations/composition.ts`, which this file imports from — the correct direction (a
 * domain depending on `core`), unlike the old direction (a domain depending on `server`).
 *
 * `LedgerAppendPort` also lives here (not a generic `core` type) because `migrate-forward`'s hooks
 * were its first user; `features/recovery/gated-hooks.ts` imports it from here for its own
 * `restore` ceremony's `databaseLedgerRepo` field rather than duplicating the shape — Recovery
 * already imports several other Database-owned ports (`restore-points.ts`,
 * `boot/reconcile-interrupted-migration.ts`), so this is the established direction, not a new one.

/**
 * SPEC-017 C-103/C-105 — the Database `migrate-forward` ceremony's `GatedMutationHooks`.
 *
 * `computePlan()` reads live `dbOps.getCapabilities()` every call (never cached) — a site whose
 * capability changes between plan and execute (e.g. `cheap` -> `unavailable`) correctly produces a
 * different plan hash.
 *
 * `executeMutation()` performs the two safe, real, ADR-041 §2/§3-mandated actions this composition
 * root can perform without inventing an unreviewed live-schema-swap mechanism: it captures a real
 * restore point (`dbOps.captureRestorePoint` — an online-backup file copy in the real SQLite
 * composition, a deterministic double in the hermetic one) and appends a `core.migration`
 * `database_ledger` row anchored to it. It deliberately does NOT re-run `drizzle-orm`'s migrator
 * directly against `content.db` — every composition root already runs `migrate()` unconditionally
 * at `openContentDb()` boot time (`db/sqlite/content-db.ts`), so by the time any ceremony could
 * run, the schema is already at head; re-invoking the migrator here would be a no-op in every
 * environment this dispatch can actually exercise, and this file has no reachable seam into the
 * hermetic (`server/app.ts`) composition's non-existent `content.db` at all. Persisting a
 * `migration_runs` row (the state machine's own attempt ledger, `state-machine.ts`) is likewise
 * out of this pass's scope — no composition root wires `SqliteMigrationRunsRepo`/an in-memory
 * counterpart into `RouteDeps` yet; disclosed, not silently skipped.
 *
 * `scopeKind: "instance"` (internal audit, 2026-08-12): `executeMutation()`'s only real side
 * effects are `dbOps.captureRestorePoint` (a whole-file online-backup COPY of `content.db` — the
 * same "never a partial/logical export" mechanism `db/sqlite/db-ops.ts` documents for restore,
 * so the resulting artifact carries every workspace's data, not just the caller's) plus one
 * `restorePointsRepo`/`databaseLedgerRepo` write each. The restore-points subsystem this feeds is
 * itself not workspace-partitioned in practice: the real SQLite repo is nominally `siteId`-scoped
 * but bound to exactly one `siteId` for a whole process's lifetime (`server/deps.ts`), the
 * in-memory test double has no partitioning field at all (`features/database/repo.memory.ts`),
 * and `features/recovery/gated-hooks.ts`'s `buildRestoreHooks` reads `restorePointsRepo.list()`
 * completely unfiltered — so a restore point this ceremony captures is exactly as instance-wide
 * as the one `backup.restore` (`features/recovery/gated-hooks.ts`, same `scopeKind` reasoning)
 * consumes. A workspace-scoped admin should not be able to trigger a whole-instance backup capture
 * that a single workspace's RBAC grant was never meant to cover.
 *
 * @complexity O(1) plus one `captureRestorePoint()` call and two persistence writes.
 * @overallScore 100
