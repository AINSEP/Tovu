/**
 * @file SPEC-017 C-107 / CIC U-004 / INV-08 / REQ-28 / REQ-29 — cost-gated `SERVE_SITE` auto-
 * migrate policy (ADR-041 §10, amends SPEC-003).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Routes serve-time migration through the same snapshot-anchored ceremony as an interactive
 * migration, gated by `costClass`: `'cheap'` (the common SQLite whole-file-snapshot case)
 * auto-migrates under a reserved no-token boot policy attributed to the seeded `kind='system'`
 * principal; `'expensive'`/`'unavailable'` refuse to auto-migrate and instead enter the site into
 * `PENDING_MIGRATION`, requiring an interactive plan/confirm/execute before normal serving
 * resumes.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * Must only ever run AFTER `reconcile-interrupted-migration.ts`'s `reconcileInterruptedMigrationOnBoot`
 * has resolved for this boot cycle (U-004-ORD1) — the boot composition root's own call-site
 * ordering is what actually enforces that sequencing; this function additionally refuses,
 * defense-in-depth, if it ever observes a still-non-terminal `migration_runs` row itself (U-004-B1),
 * so an out-of-order wiring bug fails closed rather than silently auto-migrating over an unresolved
 * crash.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/database` domain logic. Depends only on the injected ports.
