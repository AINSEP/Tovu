/**
 * @file The shared "AC-11 fixture" — built-in `word-count` plus one valid and one invalid site
 * plugin — reused verbatim by `discovery.integration.test.ts` (AC-11) and
 * `plugins-http.integration.test.ts` (AC-18, via the HTTP surface). Also mirrored (as a literal
 * JSON shape, not a shared import — `apps/admin` is a separate package with its own module
 * resolution) by `apps/admin/src/sections/__tests__/Plugins.test.tsx`'s mocked fetch response.
 *
 * RT-009 (Red-Team, v1.1.1 amendment pass): AC-18 explicitly reuses "the AC-11 fixture." Per the
 * 1.1.1 `plugin.tier` fix, `tier` is now a required manifest field with no safe default — a
 * manifest missing it is unconditionally `invalid` (`MANIFEST_MALFORMED`). This fixture's "valid"
 * site plugin therefore declares `tier: "tier-3"` explicitly, so it does not spuriously become
 * invalid under 1.1.1 and produce the wrong row distribution (two invalid rows instead of one
 * valid + one invalid). The "invalid" site plugin ALSO declares a valid `tier` — its invalidity is
 * isolated to exactly one unrelated condition (an undeclared hook point, `HOOK_UNKNOWN`) so this
 * fixture never conflates the tier concern with the "is this plugin supposed to be invalid" concern.
