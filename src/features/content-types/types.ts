/**
 * @file SPEC-020 (ADR-022 §1-4, ADR-043) — shared vocabulary for the `content-types` package.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The closed field-kind enum, the content-type record shape, and the generic `Result<T,E>`
 * envelope every write-service/lifecycle/cleanup export in this package returns. Kept as plain
 * data types with no I/O so every other module in this package (and `features/entries`, which
 * consumes a content type's `fields` to validate an entry's `fieldsJson`) can depend on it
 * without pulling in any adapter.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * ADR-022 §3's expression-index query surface requires the field-kind enum to be closed and
 * mapped through a fixed lookup table (`index-provisioning.ts`), never interpolated — this file
 * is that enum's single source of truth so the write-service's validation and the index
 * provisioner's CAST-mapping can never drift apart.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/content-types` domain vocabulary. No dependencies.
