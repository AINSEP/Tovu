/**
 * @file The single untrusted-input boundary for a content type's `fields` payload — used by BOTH
 * callers that accept one from outside the process: the admin HTTP routes
 * (`server/routes/admin/content-types/{register,update-fields}.ts`) and the agent-tool handlers
 * (`assistant/tool-registrations.ts`).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Before this module both call sites did the same two things: check `Array.isArray(body.fields)`
 * and then cast the result to `ContentTypeFieldDef[]`. The cast was the whole of the nested-shape
 * validation, which left three real gaps:
 *
 * 1. `required` and `queryable` were never type-checked anywhere in the codebase, so
 *    `queryable: "yes"` counted as queryable (`write-service.ts`'s `countQueryableFields` filters
 *    on truthiness) and `required: "maybe"` was persisted verbatim into the stored record and its
 *    revision `stateJson`. That is a data-integrity gap, not merely a sloppy contract.
 * 2. A non-object element (`fields: [null]`) made the field-name grammar guard throw a bare
 *    `TypeError` on `field.name` instead of returning a typed rejection — a 500 on the HTTP path
 *    and an opaque `'failed'` tool execution on the agent path.
 * 3. A misspelled key (`queryible: true`) was silently dropped rather than reported, so a caller
 *    got a field that was quietly non-queryable with no indication why.
 *
 * Division of responsibility (deliberate, and the reason this module is narrow):
 * this module owns STRUCTURE only — array-ness, element object-ness, the four keys and their
 * types. It does NOT own the domain rules. The field-name grammar gate, the reserved-key check and
 * the queryable-field cap stay solely in `write-service.ts`'s CIC U-002-B1 guard chain, whose
 * fixed order (`key grammar -> reserved-key -> field-name grammar -> field-kind -> queryable-cap`)
 * and stop-at-first-failure behavior are pinned by
 * `__tests__/unit/write-service.register.unit.test.ts` (AC-38). Duplicating any of those here
 * would either reorder that chain for boundary callers or create a second source of truth for a
 * rule GOV-ADR-003 requires to have exactly one.
 *
 * The one exception is `kind`, and it is a reuse rather than a restatement: this module calls the
 * same `isContentTypeFieldKind` predicate guard 4 calls and raises the same
 * `InvalidFieldKindError` guard 4 raises. Verifying it here is what lets this function honestly
 * return `ContentTypeFieldDef[]` instead of handing back another unchecked cast. Both call sites
 * already map that error class to `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`, so no HTTP response shape changes.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/content-types` domain logic. Pure — no I/O, no clock, no repo. Depends only on this
 * package's own `types.ts` and `errors.ts`.

 * `queryable` subset, so a payload of a million non-queryable fields was accepted and persisted
 * as one JSON blob. Deliberately far above any plausible real content type so it can never act as
