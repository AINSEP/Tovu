 * @file The `api_keys` record shape and its two ports (ADR-021 / SPEC-006 REQ-08, state.spec §2).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `@jini-ai/cms/identity` ships nine repo ports and deliberately stops there — its `INFO.md` names
 * API keys as the one identity table left out of that pass. This file is the tenth port, declared
 * HERE rather than in the library because api-key issuance/verification is implemented in this
 * host (`api-key-service.ts`), and a port belongs with the code that consumes it.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Interfaces and types only — no logic, mirroring `@jini-ai/cms/identity`'s own `ports.ts`. The
 * two adapters are `repo.memory.ts` (`InMemoryApiKeyRepo`) and `repo.sqlite.ts`
 * (`SqliteApiKeyRepo`) — a real ADR-006 rule-of-two, not a single-adapter port.

 * One issued key. `keyHash` is a digest of the key's SECRET half only; the raw key exists exactly
 * once, in `APIKEY_ISSUE`'s response, and is never stored or logged (INV-05).
 *
 * `prefix` is the key's non-secret half, stored in the clear on purpose: it is the lookup handle
 * that turns verification into one indexed row read plus one hash comparison. Without it, a salted
 * KDF digest (which is not a deterministic function of the key alone) would force a full-table
 * scan hashing every row on every request.
