/**
 * @file `webhook-inbox.ts` — provider webhook ingestion (2026-08-12 swarm-consensus debate,
 * section 5: "idempotency AND ordering — they are different problems").
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `ingestProviderEvent` is the thin service boundary over `CommerceWebhookEventRepoPort
 * .applyProviderEvent` (`repo.sqlite.ts`), which owns the actual atomic guard: `(provider,
 * eventId)` UNIQUE stops replay; a single `UPDATE ... WHERE providerEventAt < ?` inside the same
 * transaction stops a chronologically-older event from overwriting a newer one that already
 * landed. Neither alone is sufficient — see the repo port's own doc.
 *
 * Deliberately excludes signature verification. There is no live payment-provider adapter
 * anywhere in this codebase yet (`CommercePaymentRuntimePort.listProviders()` has no composed
 * runtime — see `contracts.ts`/`status.ts`), so there is no provider-specific signing secret to
 * verify against and no route wiring this into an HTTP endpoint yet either. A real provider
 * adapter (Stripe or otherwise) MUST verify the request signature before calling this function —
 * `ingestProviderEvent` trusts `event` completely, exactly like `handleVerifiedCommerceEvent`'s
 * own naming in the debate's Round 3 offload made explicit ("Signature verification occurs
 * before this call").
 *
 * `projection.status`/`orderId` are caller-supplied, not derived here, for the same reason: this
 * slice has no live provider to ask "what is this object's authoritative current state" — a real
 * adapter's `ProviderProjectionPort`-equivalent (debate Round 3) owns that translation. This
 * module's job stops at "apply an already-decided projection exactly once, in order."

 *   changed. `"stale"` — a new event, but chronologically older than what is already applied to
 *   the order; recorded as `"ignored"` in the inbox, the order is untouched. `"applied"` — the
 *   order's `status`/ordering cursor were updated.
 *

 *   a single DB transaction. Space: O(1).
