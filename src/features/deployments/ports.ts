/**
 * @file The provider-neutral deployment port — the seam every first-party adapter
 * (`./providers/github.ts`, and later others) implements once.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Mirrors `features/plugins/lipay/ports.ts`'s `PaymentProvider` discipline, which this codebase
 * already uses for a structurally similar problem (many third-party providers behind one typed,
 * never-throwing port, all outbound HTTP through the ADR-038 guarded seam): no method throws
 * (every failure is a typed `DeploymentError`), credentials are pre-resolved and injected as a flat
 * bundle rather than read by the adapter, and `ctx.httpClient` is the only permitted path to the
 * network.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * `EgressPolicy` (`#src/http/ports.ts`) is bound once, at `HttpClientPort` construction
 * (`createHttpClient({ transport, policy })` — `src/http/client.ts`), not per request; there is no
 * per-request policy field on `HttpRequest`. It also has no field that can restrict which HOST a
 * request reaches (`devHostAllowlist` only exempts a host from the private-address check). So
 * origin pinning for a specific provider's API is the ADAPTER's responsibility, asserted through a
 * single chokepoint every outbound call is forced through — see `./providers/github.ts`'s
 * `sendPinned`, the only function in that file allowed to call `ctx.httpClient.send`.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * INTERFACES ONLY. `./providers/github.ts` is the first (and, this pass, only) implementation.

 * - No `validateTarget` — admin "configure target" UX is out of scope for this slice.
 * - No `cancelRun` — the R1-R3 debate consensus is that rollback IS `startRun` with a prior

 *   for an already-created deployment in any case.
 * - No streaming-logs method — `EgressPolicy`'s response caps are sized for bounded JSON, not a
