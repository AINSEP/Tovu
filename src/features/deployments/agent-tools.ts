/**
 * @file The Deployments domain's agent-tool catalog (2026-08-15 — closes the "the owner can deploy
 * by typing CLI commands, but cannot ask the assistant to do it" gap: none of the 21 existing
 * `assistant/tool-registrations.ts` domains covered the Deployment panel's three tabs at all).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * A static catalog describing every agent-callable tool this domain exposes and the permission each
 * one carries. All five entries here are wired (`tool-registrations.ts` in this directory) — unlike
 * `features/recovery/agent-tools.ts` or `features/database/agent-tools.ts`, this catalog has no
 * excluded, token-gated, or otherwise-dangerous entry: an export writes a static COPY (never touches
 * the running site's own database or content), and a Dockerfile edit writes one build file that
 * still needs a human to run `docker build`/`docker push` in a terminal — neither operation is the
 * kind of irreversible cross-domain mutation ADR-041/ADR-045 reserve for a human-only lever.
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * The server-side tool filter (ADR-014) consumes this catalog to decide which tool names an agent
 * session may see at all; `tool-registrations.ts`'s handlers, each wrapping an existing HTTP route's
 * own domain logic (`features/deployments/export-run.ts`, `features/deployments/dockerfile.ts`,
 * `features/deployments/read-repo.ts`), enforce the actual permission checks at call time — this
 * module declares shape only, no I/O.
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * `features/deployments` domain logic. No dependencies.
