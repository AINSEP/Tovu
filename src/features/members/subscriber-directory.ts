/**
 * @file `MembersSubscriberDirectory` — Members' implementation of Newsletter's
 * `SubscriberDirectoryPort` read seam (ADR-030 §4 entitlement axis; ADR-034 OPEN-1).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Newsletter's `src/newsletter/ports.ts` declares `SubscriberDirectoryPort` as the
 * read-only seam it needs into Members to resolve a subscriber's address/deliverability
 * at audience-materialization time. This file is the one real implementation Members
 * owns for that seam — `subscriberId` IS `memberId` (ADR-030: "Publish
 * `AudienceDirectoryPort` (`getContacts→{memberId,email,emailDeliverable}`);
 * `subscriberId = memberId`").
 *
 * Scope note — GLOBAL suppression only (ADR-030 D1c is NOT implemented here):
 * ADR-030 §D1c (LOCKED 4-0) describes a purpose-keyed `member_consents` ledger and a
 * `consentPurpose`-scoped `getContacts` filter. That ledger does not exist anywhere in
 * this codebase (`grep -rln consent src/members/` is empty) — building it is out of
 * scope for this seam. What IS implemented is D1c's other half, the GLOBAL rule:
 * "Global `emailDeliverable`/suppression = active ∧ verified ∧ no global suppression."
 * `MemberRecord`/`MemberSubscriptionRecord` carry no suppression/unsubscribed-globally
 * field today (confirmed: no "suppress" hit in `src/members/types.ts` or `ports.ts`),
 * so the "no global suppression" clause is currently vacuously true — disclosed here
 * rather than inventing a new `MemberRecord` field, which would be a schema change
 * needing its own decision. `emailDeliverable` below reduces to `active ∧ verified`
 * until a suppression concept is added to `MemberRecord` (or a dedicated ledger).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Single-evaluator typed dependency per `src/newsletter/ports.ts`'s header comment —
 * NOT a second `SubscriberDirectoryPort` adapter (no ADR-006 rule-of-two obligation).
 * Depends only on `MemberRepoPort` (read-only); never touches `MemberSubscriptionRepoPort`
 * because global deliverability does not depend on tier/subscription state, only on the
 * member account's own lifecycle fields.
 *
 * Resource-bounds note (backend-implementation 5a4): `MemberRepoPort` exposes no
 * batch/multi-id lookup, so `getContacts` loops `findById` once per requested id. This
 * is an N+1 pattern; it is accepted here rather than adding a new repo method because
 * the only known caller (the newsletter outbox worker, `SendBatchJob.sendIds`) already
 * slices a campaign's audience into bounded per-job batches before calling this seam —
 * the collection size is bounded upstream by that design, not by this file. If a caller
 * ever passes a whole-campaign-sized `subscriberIds` array directly, a batched
 * `MemberRepoPort.findByIds` method should be added instead of parallelizing unbounded
 * `Promise.all` fan-out here. Flagged as a future N+1 concern, not fixed in this task.
