/**
 * @file Ranked full-text search over Posts + Pages — the domain half (contract, input rules, and
 * the pure `body_json` -> plain text projection). The two adapters that actually rank live in
 * `search-index.sqlite.ts` (durable, the production one) and `search-index.memory.ts` (the
 * rule-of-two partner for the hermetic composition root).
 *
 * WHY this exists at all, given `listAdminPosts` already lists posts. `content_post_list`'s own
 * catalog description states its limits honestly: `kind` is required, there is no status/date/limit
 * filter, and it returns the FULL `bodyJson` of every row. That is fine as a mirror of an admin list
 * screen and unusable as a way for an agent to FIND something — on a real site it dumps the entire
 * corpus into the model's context to answer "where's the page about pricing". This module is the
 * find-shaped read: a query in, a short ranked list of summaries out, `bodyJson` never included.
 *
 * WHY the port is handed tokens and a clamped limit rather than a raw query string. Two reasons,
 * both about keeping the adapters honest:
 *  1. FTS5's MATCH argument is a QUERY LANGUAGE, not a string literal — `"`, `*`, `NOT`, `NEAR`, and
 *     `column:` all mean something. Tokenizing to alphanumeric runs here (the identical rule
 *     `@jini-ai/sqlite`'s `searchToolCatalog` applies, and for the identical reason) means no
 *     adapter can be handed a string that reaches FTS5 as anything but plain terms. Doing it at the
 *     domain boundary rather than inside one adapter means the second adapter cannot forget.
 *  2. `limit` has a hard cap, and a cap enforced in the port's contract cannot be bypassed by a
 *     caller constructing the port call directly.
 *
 * WHAT this module does NOT decide: whether a row is visible. Workspace scoping, the soft-delete
 * (trash) exclusion, and the `kind`/`status` filters are applied by the adapter against the LIVE
 * `posts` row, never against indexed copies of those fields — see `search-index.sqlite.ts` for why
 * that placement is what makes a publish or a trash take effect with no index write at all.
 */

/**
 * One ranked result. Summary fields only — deliberately the same projection
 * `tool-registrations.ts`'s `toPostToolView` publishes, MINUS `bodyJson` and `version`.
 *
 * `bodyJson`'s absence is the whole point of the feature and is not a field anyone should add back:
 * a search that returns full documents has reintroduced exactly the context blowup it exists to
 * avoid. `snippet` is the bounded substitute — enough for a model to tell two similar hits apart,
 * not enough to be a document read. A caller that genuinely needs the body already has
 * `content_post_get` and now has the id to call it with.
