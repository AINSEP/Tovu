/**
 * @file Ports + typed-call contracts for the Tovu `navigation` library (ADR-029).
 *
 * ADR-006 (rule-of-two) applied honestly to navigation:
 *
 * - **`NavLocationBindingRepoPort` IS a port.** It persists the derived
 *   `nav_location_bindings` index and has two real adapters, one built now:
 *   in-memory (dev/tests) + SQLite (persistent) — the same shape every other
 *   repo in this codebase already follows (`PostRepoPort`, `SettingsRepoPort`,
 *   `ChangeSetRepoPort`). Rule-of-two passes. (Previously cited
 *   `PresentationSettingsRepoPort` here — SPEC-007/ADR-PIPE-007 retires that
 *   port in favor of `settings`' `getEffective`/`SettingsRepoPort`; this file
 *   has no functional dependency on either, so only the analogy reference
 *   changes.)
 *
 * - **Menus themselves add NO new persistence port.** A menu is an ADR-022
 *   entry; it rides the existing entries repo (in-memory + SQLite), which
 *   already passes rule-of-two. Inventing a `MenuRepoPort` would be a second
 *   store for data that already has one.
 *
 * - **`NavTargetResolver` is NOT a port — it is one evaluator.** Resolving a
 *   target ref to an href/label is ordinary core code over routing + entries +
 *   taxonomy (ADR-009 §1 typed calls). There is exactly one production
 *   implementation, so — following ADR-021 §2's self-application of ADR-006 to
 *   `authorize()` ("no PolicyPort; one evaluator") — it stays a plain typed-call
 *   contract, refactored into a port only if a second real resolver appears.
 *
 * INTERFACES ONLY. No feature logic lives here.
