/**
 * @file Render-time read model for the Tovu `navigation` library (ADR-029 §7).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `resolveForLocation` is the one typed call a theme renderer makes: look up
 * the menu bound to a location, then walk its stored item tree into a
 * `ResolvedNav` — concrete hrefs, `available` flags, active-state — so the
 * theme "receives resolved data, never resolves refs" (ADR-020 §6).
 *
 * How it relates to the project:
 * - `entryRef`/`termRef`/`route` targets need a resolver over entries/taxonomy/
 *   routing. `src/routing` (ADR-039) is being built in parallel by another
 *   agent and is not running code yet, so this module does NOT import it.
 *   Instead it takes an injected `resolveTargetHref` function as a dependency —
 *   the exact seam `src/routing`'s `urlFor`/`isActive` will later back. This
 *   keeps `resolver.ts` compiling and testable today with a fake, and wiring
 *   the real routing implementation in later is a pure DI swap, not a rewrite.
 * - `url` targets are already-resolved hrefs (validated at write time in
 *   `menu-service.ts`) and pass straight through.
 * - `termRef` targets: per the ADR-029 Round-3 audit fold item 1, term-link
 *   integrity has **no compatible ADR-022 schema yet** (`entry_refs` is
 *   entry-to-entry only) — this is a named Wave-1 blocker, not an oversight.
 *   This resolver does not special-case `termRef`; it is passed to the same
 *   injected `resolveTargetHref` as `entryRef`/`route`, and a fake/real
 *   resolver that has no term schema to consult should return `null`, which
 *   this module already turns into `available: false` on that node only (the
 *   rest of the tree still resolves).
 *
 * Architectural role:
 * Pure read-side feature logic. No storage writes; no theme code reachable
 * from here reads storage directly (ADR-020 §6 render-IR boundary honored by
 * returning only `ResolvedNav`/`ResolvedNavItem` data).

 * `available: false`, which means "resolved to a real target that is
