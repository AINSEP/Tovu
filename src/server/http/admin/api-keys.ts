/**
 * @file Admin-facing api-key response DTOs (mirrors `admin/users.ts`'s pattern).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * The one place that decides what an api-key row may show a client. `ApiKeyRecord.keyHash` has no
 * field on any shape here, so there is nothing to forward by accident (INV-05) — the same
 * structural defence `AdminUserResponse` uses against `UserRecord.passwordHash`.
 *
 * `rawKey` is the deliberate exception, and it is NOT read off a record: `toApiKeyIssueResponse`
 * takes it as a separate argument, because the only value that ever carries it is `issueApiKey`'s
 * in-memory return, never a row. A second call for the same key cannot re-emit it.
