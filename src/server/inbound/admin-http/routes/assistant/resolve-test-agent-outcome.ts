 * Pure decision logic behind `test-agent.ts`'s POST route — split out of that route handler so the
 * installed/authenticated/model-mismatch/success branches (everything AFTER "the CLI was found on
 * PATH") can be unit-tested directly against fabricated `DetectedAgent` objects.
 *
 * Why this had to move: `test-agent.ts` calls `detectAgents()` (a real, no-network local PATH scan
 * + auth probe) as a direct static import, not through an injectable dep, so those branches used to
 * be reachable only by whichever CLIs happen to be installed and authenticated on the machine
 * running the suite — see `admin-assistant-execution-routes.test.ts`'s header, which documents this
 * as an "accepted coverage gap." Faking `detectAgents()` itself would need Node's `mock.module()`,
 * gated behind `--experimental-test-module-mocks`, a flag this repo's test scripts do not pass.
 * `resolveTestAgentOutcome` needs no PATH scan, no subprocess, and no module mock — just an object
 * literal — so all four branches below are now deterministic regardless of host.
 *
 * Only called once `agent` is already known non-null and `agent.available` — the route's own
 * "not found on this server's PATH" branch is unaffected and stays covered at the HTTP level in
 * `admin-assistant-execution-routes.test.ts`.
