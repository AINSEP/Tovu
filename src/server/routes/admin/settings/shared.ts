/**
 * @file Shared plumbing for the `settings` admin route registrars
 * (SPEC-007 Phase 5).
 *
 * Purpose:
 * `write-service.ts` declares its own smaller `SettingsWriteServiceDeps`
 * shape (`repo`/`clock`/`ids`/`authorize`/`principals`) rather than reusing
 * `RouteDeps` directly (see that file's header) — this adapter maps the
 * flat `RouteDeps` fields onto it once so every settings route file doesn't
 * repeat the same five-field object literal.
 *
 * Retyped from `RouteDeps` to `SettingsRouteDeps` (ADR-046 Phase 3, SPEC-040) — a pure narrowing,
 * since this function already only ever reads fields the new narrow type includes; see
 * `deps.ts`'s file header for the confirmed field set.
