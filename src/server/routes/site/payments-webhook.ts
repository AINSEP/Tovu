/**
 * @file The one core-owned payment webhook route: `POST /payments/webhook/:providerId`.
 *
 * Public and unauthenticated by necessity — a payment provider has no Tovu session. Authentication
 * IS the provider's signature verification, performed inside `parseWebhook`. This is the deliberate
 * inverse of WooCommerce's `do_action('woocommerce_api_' . $api_request)`, where the hook suffix is
 * a lowercased class name, two plugins can trivially collide on it, and there is no verification,
 * no routing table and no delivery log. Here `:providerId` is a registry lookup and a miss is a
 * typed `PROVIDER_NOT_REGISTERED`.
 *
 * THE RAW-BODY FIX (the reason this file is registered where it is). `app.ts` mounts one blanket
 * `express.json({ limit: "15mb" })` ahead of all route registration; by the time an ordinary
 * handler runs, `req.body` is a parsed object and the original bytes are gone. HMAC signatures are
 * computed over exact bytes, and a parse-then-reserialize round trip changes key order and
 * whitespace, so verification would fail for every provider.
 *
 * The fix is registration ORDER, not a second parser. Express matches layers in the order they were
 * added, so this route — registered before the blanket `express.json` layer — runs its own
 * `express.raw({ type: "application/json", limit: "1mb" })` and then terminates the response, and
 * the blanket JSON parser is never reached for this one path. Everything else in the app is
 * untouched.
 *
 * The rejected alternative was stashing a buffer from `express.json`'s `verify` hook: that pays the
 * cost on every request in the process, and `middleware/body-size-limit.ts`'s header already
 * documents that `body-parser` marks a parsed request so a later `express.json()` silently no-ops —
 * an interaction worth not depending on.
 *
 * Registering early has one structural consequence in this codebase's boot sequence: `createApp()`
 * is synchronous, while lipay is a Tier-2 plugin activated asynchronously against a real SQLite
 * handle (`bootstrapLipay`), and the hermetic in-memory composition has no lipay at all. So the API
 * is resolved through a callback at REQUEST time rather than captured at registration time — that
 * is what decouples "must be registered before line 444" from "cannot be activated that early".
