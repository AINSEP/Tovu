# Models, plans, and credits

Everything here was observed against the live connected Higgsfield account on 2026-09-09. Where a
fact is about *this* account rather than about Higgsfield in general, it says so.

---

## `models_explore` — what it actually answers

`mcp__higgsfield__models_explore` takes an `action`:

| action | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `recommend` | "which model suits this goal" — pass `query` plus input context |
| `get` | one model's constraints (`model_id` required) |
| `list` / `search` | browsing the catalog |

Useful filters: `type` (`image` / `video` / `audio` / `3d`) and `input` (`text` for text-only,
`image` for models that accept reference media). For a plain text prompt with no reference image,
`{"action":"recommend","type":"image","input":"text"}` is the right query.

Each returned item carries its own `aspect_ratios`, `parameters`, and durations. Some carry
`supports_unlim` — see below, and do not read it as "this is free for me."

**`models_explore` is read-only and needs no write grant.** Only `generate_image` does.

---

## Cost preflight: `get_cost`

`generate_image` accepts `get_cost: true` inside `params`. It prices the request and **submits
nothing**:

```json
{ "params": { "model": "recraft_v4_1", "prompt": "…", "get_cost": true } }
```

Observed response:

```
Cost preflight for recraft_v4_1: 1.25 credits (1.25 exact). No job submitted.
```

with `structuredContent.cost = { credits: 1.25, credits_exact: 1.25 }`.

Use it when the operator asks what something will cost, or before a model you have not used
before. It is the one call in this integration that is guaranteed free of side effects.

**A successful preflight does not mean the generation will be accepted.** On this account the
preflight for `recraft_v4_1` succeeded *and the submit that followed it was refused* by the plan
gate. Preflight proves the connection, the auth, and the model id are all fine. It says nothing
about the account's entitlement to start a job.

---

## The plan gate

Some models are refused at submit time with exactly this:

```
Error starting generation: Requires basic plan or higher.
```

The structured payload carries `monetization_intent: "upgrade"`, a `recovery_tool` of
`show_plans_and_credits`, and a `request_id`.

Observed on the connected account, 2026-09-09:

| Model | Preflight | Submit |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt_image_2` (Higgsfield's own stated default) | — | ✗ Requires basic plan or higher |
| `recraft_v4_1` | ✓ 1.25 credits | ✗ Requires basic plan or higher |
| `z_image` | — | ✓ Job submitted, image delivered |

### How to read this correctly

**It is an account gate, not a model gate.** Two different models from two different providers
returning the *identical* message is the tell. Do not conclude "that model id is wrong" or "the
Higgsfield connection is broken" — the connection is demonstrably fine, because the preflight on
the same model in the same session succeeded.

**Do not retry it.** The account's plan does not change between two tool calls.

**Try a model that is not gated before you escalate.** `z_image` is the one verified to work on
this account. This is worth one attempt, and it is the difference between delivering the image
and handing the operator a bill.

**If everything is gated, stop and ask.** Present it as a real choice — upgrading the Higgsfield
plan is the operator's money. Note that `show_plans_and_credits`, the recovery tool Higgsfield
itself names, is **not in this deployment's operator allowlist**, so you cannot call it. Say what
you found and let them decide.

## The free-trial "unlim" allowance is not a fallback

`models_explore` reports a top-level `unlim` block, and items may carry `supports_unlim`. On this
account it reports:

```
unlim: { available: false }
```

with the server's own note that unlim is *"not spendable right now"* and that passing `use_unlim`
returns a typed rejection rather than a generation.

So: **`supports_unlim` on a model does not mean you can use it.** The model-level flag says the
model *accepts* unlim generations; the top-level `available` says whether this caller can spend
any. Read the top-level one. When it is `false`, `use_unlim` is not an escape from the plan gate
— it is a second, differently-worded refusal.

Note also that `use_unlim` caps `count` to 1 regardless of what you asked for.

## What is and is not enabled here

This plugin covers images and video. The workflow's tool list includes `generate_image` and
`generate_video`, followed by `job_status` polling and `media_import_from_url` for the completed
CDN asset. The owner confirmed video coverage on 2026-10-04. Consult the live federated tool list
for each generator's input schema and the current connection's allowlist/write grants.

The seven-tool, image-only allowlist recorded during the September image trial was a snapshot of
that operator's connection, not a limit imposed by this plugin. `plugin.json` currently declares
only `models_explore` and `job_status` as default read tools; it does not deny video or automatically
grant generation writes. For a video request, `generate_video` must be both allowlisted and granted
"may write", just as `generate_image` is for images. SKILL.md's setup table includes both.

For video, use the same asynchronous chain: submit `generate_video`, poll `job_status` without
`sync:true` until completion, then import the video CDN URL using `media_import_from_url`.
The import tool accepts `video/mp4` and `video/webm`. A job id alone does not mean the video
exists or has reached the site's Media library. Select a video model using the live model list;
image-model plan results above do not establish a video model's availability.

Other advertised tools (upscaling, billing, publishing, deployment, or sandbox execution) still
require their own operator allowlist entries and write grants where applicable. A
`not-in-operator-allowlist` refusal describes that connection's current policy; report the missing
grant only when it blocks the capability the operator requested.
