description: Set up a hosted database (Supabase) for this site from chat. Start with agent_plugin_connect, then find or create the database, handle Supabase's free limit of two active databases (reuse, pause, or paid), and say everything in plain words. Small database changes (make a table, add or change rows) run from chat with execute_sql, after the person confirms each one.

# Supabase database

The person wants somewhere to keep data (sign-ups, form entries, app data). Get them a working
database with as few words and choices as possible. They should never need to learn a new idea.

## Rules for everything you say

Write every message in plain, short sentences. Lines quoted below as `> ...` are what the person
reads; say them in your own words if needed, but keep them this simple.

**Never say** any of these words or ideas to the person: token, access token, OAuth, MCP, plugin,
scope, allowlist, read-only, region, org or organization id, project ref, API key, service role,
tool names. Never show a key or password. Call the Supabase project "your database".

Links: always markdown links to `https://` pages, one per message at most. Tovu opens them in a
new tab, so the chat stays open.

Never loop. If a step fails twice, stop and use `references/failure-modes.md`.

## Step 1. Connect (always first)

Call `agent_plugin_connect { pluginId: "supabase" }` before any Supabase tool, every time, even if
you think it is already connected (it returns at once when it is).

It shows the person a card with a sign-in button. Before or with it, say:

> Let's set up your database. It's free and takes about two minutes. You'll sign in to Supabase,
> the database service Tovu uses. No account yet? Choose **Sign up** there (GitHub or email). If it
> asks which team to use, pick any.

The person signs up for their own Supabase account; you never make one for them and never ask for
their email or password.

- Result `{ status: "connected" }`: go to Step 2.
- Result `{ status: "waiting-for-sign-in" }`: see `references/failure-modes.md`.

## Step 2. Find their account and databases

1. Call `mcp__supabase__list_organizations`. Normally there is one; use it. If there are several,
   ask with `assistant_ask_choice` using their names.
2. Call `mcp__supabase__list_projects`. Keep the ones in that organization.
3. If they already have databases, ask with `assistant_ask_choice`:
   - **Make a new database** (first option, recommended)
   - **Use "<name>"** for each existing one

   If they pick an existing one, go to Step 5 (if its status is `INACTIVE` it is asleep: see
   `references/failure-modes.md`).

## Step 3. Check the free limit and the price

Supabase's free plan allows **two active databases** per account. `mcp__supabase__get_cost` can't
see the free limit (it says $0 even when the account is full), so count first:

- From Step 2's list, count databases whose status is not `INACTIVE` (active or starting).
- If the count is 2 or more and the cost below is $0, the account is at the free limit: skip
  creating and go straight to **At the free limit** below.

Call `mcp__supabase__get_cost { type: "project", organization_id }`.

- $0: say nothing about money.
- More than $0 (a paid account): ask with `assistant_ask_choice`:
  - **Create it ($<amount>/<recurrence>)**, using the exact numbers returned
  - **Cancel**

  Only on **Create it**, call `mcp__supabase__confirm_cost` with the same `type`, `recurrence` and
  `amount`, and keep the returned id for Step 4.

## Step 4. Create the database

Call `mcp__supabase__create_project` with:
- `name`: short and lowercase, from the site's name or what they are building (never ask);
- `organization_id` from Step 2;
- `region`: nearest to the person, from the table below (default `us-east-1`);
- `confirm_cost_id` from Step 3 when there was one.

| Person is in | region |
|---|---|
| US East, Canada East, or unknown | `us-east-1` |
| US West | `us-west-1` |
| Canada | `ca-central-1` |
| South America | `sa-east-1` |
| UK, Ireland | `eu-west-2` |
| Western / Central Europe | `eu-central-1` |
| Nordics | `eu-north-1` |
| India | `ap-south-1` |
| Southeast Asia | `ap-southeast-1` |
| Japan | `ap-northeast-1` |
| Korea | `ap-northeast-2` |
| Australia, New Zealand | `ap-southeast-2` |

If it fails with an error containing
"maximum limits for the number of active free plan projects", the account is at the free limit: go
to **At the free limit**.

Then say:

> Creating your database... this usually takes 1-2 minutes.

Call `mcp__supabase__get_project` to check its status, at most 10 times in one reply. Ready when the
status is `ACTIVE_HEALTHY`. Still not ready after that:

> Your database is still being made. Say "check" in a minute and I'll look again.

## Step 5. Ready

> Your database is ready ✓ [Open it in Supabase →](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/<id>)

(`<id>` is the project's `id` from Supabase; it goes only in the link, never in the text.)

Then offer one useful next step, for example showing them where their data will appear.

## Changing data or tables

For a small change the person asks for (make a table, add a column, add, change or delete rows), use
`mcp__supabase__execute_sql` on the database they chose, with one short SQL statement per call. Use
`mcp__supabase__apply_migration` only if they ask for a tracked schema change.

1. Say in one plain sentence what will change, and show the SQL in a code block:
   > I'll make a table called "signups" with an id column. This is the SQL:
2. Call the tool. The person then sees a card with the exact SQL and **Confirm** / **Cancel**
   buttons; nothing runs until they click Confirm. Every change asks again, so keep to one change
   per call. A card marked as able to delete data is expected for these tools.
3. After it runs, check the result (for example `mcp__supabase__list_tables`) and say what changed
   in plain words.

If the result says they cancelled, say:

> OK, I didn't change anything.

Do not try the same change again unless they ask. If the card expired, say it timed out and ask if
they still want it. Never delete a table or data they did not name, and ask first before any change
that deletes data.

## At the free limit

Ask with `assistant_ask_choice` (one option per active database for the first two):

- **Use "<name>"**: continue at Step 5 with that database.
- **Pause "<name>" to free a space**: call `mcp__supabase__pause_project` on it, say
  > "<name>" is paused. Its data is kept, and you can wake it up later.
  then go back to Step 4.
- **Get a paid database**: say
  > Supabase's free plan allows two active databases. To add another, upgrade your Supabase plan
  > here, then say "done". [See plans and prices →](https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/<organization id>/billing)

  On "done", go back to Step 3: `get_cost` now shows the price, so the person sees
  **Create it ($<amount>/<recurrence>)** before anything is charged.

Tovu never takes payment itself; upgrading happens on Supabase's own page.

## When something goes wrong

Use `references/failure-modes.md`: one plain sentence for each case, and what to do next.
