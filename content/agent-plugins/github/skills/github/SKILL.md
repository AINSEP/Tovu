name: github
description: Work against a GitHub repository through this workspace's own saved credentials — write and update files in one atomic commit, dispatch and follow a GitHub Actions run, read a failed run's logs, commit the site's rendered static export — with no git, no gh CLI, and no token ever passing through the assistant. Encodes the rules generic GitHub knowledge gets wrong here: a 204 dispatch means queued and never deployed, a workflow only fires on the branch its own trigger names, a repository secret is always the human's step, a 403 on an org-wide listing is a normal app-scoped-token boundary rather than a broken credential, and editing an existing file means diffing the MODIFIED files and not only the added and deleted ones.

# GitHub, through Tovu

## Scope

This plugin owns **GitHub**: repositories, commits, branches, Actions, and the token and permission
semantics behind all of them. It owns nothing else.

It knows nothing about where a build is *deployed to*. Fly, Render, Railway, a container registry,
a VPS — none of that is here, and a rule that only makes sense for one host does not belong here.
A host-specific plugin (`tovu-deploy-fly` is the one that ships today) is expected to describe its
own hosting rules and then hand the GitHub half to this document. That split is deliberate: every
skill of every enabled plugin reaches the assistant's prompt at the same time, so the same rule
written twice, slightly differently, becomes a contradiction rather than emphasis.

## What you are allowed to use, and what does not exist here

Two native Tovu tools do everything below. **This plugin ships no MCP server and adds no tool.**

| Tool | What it is |
|---|---|
| `custom_credential_make_request` | One authenticated `GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` to GitHub's REST API through a saved credential. You pass a `label` and a **full absolute URL**; the server injects the real `Authorization` header. |
| `custom_credential_write_files` | A human-confirmed, atomic write of 1–25 named files onto an **existing** branch (blob → tree → commit → non-force ref update). |

Two more exist for a narrower job — `source_control_get_capabilities` and
`source_control_execute_commit` — and they are **not** general-purpose repo writes. See
`references/source-control.md` before you reach for either; the distinction between them and
`custom_credential_write_files` is the single easiest thing to get wrong in this document.

There is no `git`, no `gh`, and no shell path. **Never shell out to `curl`, `wget`, or `git` to
talk to GitHub.** A raw shell request bypasses the saved-credential store entirely and either
fails outright or forces a token into your context to make it work — which is exactly the thing
the store exists to prevent.

### You do not choose the host

`custom_credential_make_request` refuses any URL whose host is not on that credential's own saved
allowlist (its base URL plus any saved additional hosts), **before any request is sent**. This is
not a limitation to route around. It is the property that makes an agent-held credential safe at
all: the human decided, once, at save time, which origins this token may ever reach.

So: build every URL from `https://api.github.com` (or whatever base the credential actually
saved — GitHub Enterprise has its own). If a call is refused, the error names the hosts that
*are* allowed. Read it and use one; do not try a different host to see what sticks.

To find the label, call `content_read` with `resource: "custom_credential"`. It returns each saved
credential's label, category, base URL and additional hosts — never a token. A workspace with a
credential labelled `github` is the expected case, but do not assume the label: read it.

## The rules

These are the reason this plugin exists. Each one has cost a real debugging session.

### Rule 1 — A repository secret is ALWAYS the human's step. This is not negotiable.

Creating or updating a GitHub Actions secret through the API requires encrypting the value against
the repository's own public key. To do that, **the secret value would have to pass through your
context** — you would have to hold the plaintext token in order to encrypt it.

That is not an inconvenience on the way to a shortcut. **It is the failure mode.** The entire
saved-credential design exists so a secret never reaches the assistant, and a step that requires
holding one is a step the assistant does not perform, no matter how much friction it saves.

So you never call `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/secrets/{name}`, you never fetch
`.../actions/secrets/public-key` in order to encrypt something, and you never ask a human to paste
a token into the chat so you can do it for them. You hand them the exact instruction instead:

> Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret** in
> `<owner>/<repo>`. Name it exactly `<SECRET_NAME>`. Paste only the value — do not commit it
> anywhere, and do not paste it into this chat.

Then **wait for them to confirm.** Do not dispatch a workflow that needs a secret before they have
said it is set: the run fails on the runner in a way that reads like a config problem rather than a
missing secret, and you will debug the wrong thing.

The same rule covers environment secrets, organization secrets, and Dependabot secrets. Reading
which secret *names* exist (`GET .../actions/secrets`) is fine — GitHub never returns a value — and
is a genuinely useful way to confirm a human's "I set it" without asking twice.

### Rule 2 — A 204 from a workflow dispatch means QUEUED. It does not mean anything ran.

`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{file}/dispatches` returns **204 with an empty body**
on success. All that 204 asserts is that GitHub accepted the request.

Nothing has built. Nothing has deployed. Nothing has even started — the run may not appear in the
runs list for a second or two, and it may sit `queued` behind another run after that.

**Never report success at the dispatch.** Report "queued", then follow the run
(`references/actions.md` has the poll loop and how to read a failure). Say what you actually
observed, at the stage you observed it.

### Rule 3 — A workflow only fires on the branch its own trigger names.

A workflow's `on: push:` names branches. A push to any other branch does **nothing** — no run, no
error, no warning. The same is true of `workflow_dispatch`: the `ref` you dispatch against must be
a branch the workflow file exists on, and GitHub reads the workflow definition *from that ref*.

Two failure shapes follow, and both look like "the workflow is broken":

- You wrote the workflow onto a branch its own `push:` trigger does not list, pushed, and nothing
  happened. Nothing is broken; the trigger simply did not match.
- You dispatched against a `ref` where the workflow file does not exist yet. GitHub returns
  **422**, not 404, and the message is about the workflow rather than the ref.

So before you push or dispatch: read the workflow's own trigger, and name the branch explicitly.
Never assume `main`; a repository's default branch is a fact to look up
(`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` → `default_branch`), not a convention to rely on.

### Rule 4 — When you EDIT an existing file, diff the MODIFIED files. Not just added and deleted.

This one has already cost two silent production failures.

A history force-push once rewrote a workflow file and dropped two `--build-arg` flags from it. A
review that looked at which files were **added** and which were **deleted** saw nothing wrong —
the file was neither. It was modified, and the modification quietly removed two load-bearing lines.
Two deploys failed before anyone connected the two facts.

`custom_credential_write_files` replaces a file's **entire content**; it does not patch. So when
you are updating a file that already exists:

1. Read the current content first (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={branch}`,
   which returns base64, or the raw blob via the Git Data API).
2. Produce the new content from what is actually there — never from memory, and never from a
   template you assume matches.
3. Before writing, state what changed, **line by line, including every line you removed.**

The confirmation dialog names each path as a create or an update, resolved against the branch's
real current state. An "update" label is your cue that a full-content replacement is about to
happen and that everything you did not carry forward is about to be gone.

### Rule 5 — A 403 on an org-wide or account-wide listing is a permission BOUNDARY, not a broken credential.

Many real tokens are scoped to a single repository or a single app. Such a token can fully manage
its own resource and still **403 on any call that enumerates an organization or an account** — the
org's repositories, the account's installations, every-app-in-the-org listings.

That 403 looks *exactly* like an expired, revoked, or wrong-scoped credential. It is neither.
Misreading it once cost a full debugging session and nearly caused a working credential to be
replaced.

The rule: **prefer per-resource endpoints over listings.** If you know the `owner/repo`, ask about
that repository directly. Resolve the identifier from the human, from a file already in the repo,
or from the conversation — never by listing the org and searching it. If you genuinely have no
identifier, ask; a question costs one turn, a wrong diagnosis costs a session.

If a call does come back 401 or 403, **read the `authDiagnostic` field on the result before
reporting a bare failure**, follow the remedy it names, and retry at most **once**. There is
deliberately no diagnostic hint on a 403 at all — 403 covers scopes, policy, and missing headers,
so any guess would be a false lead. Report the failure and GitHub's own message plainly.

### Rule 6 — Never print, echo, or reconstruct a secret.

Not in a file you write, not in a commit message, not in a summary of what the human just did, not
"redacted" with the first four characters showing. If a secret value must exist, the human types
it — into GitHub's own secret form, or into a Tovu credential form's masked field.

Nothing in this plugin's procedures requires you to see one, which is what makes this rule cheap to
keep.

## Choosing the right tool

Answer one question first: **is this app source, or is it the site's rendered output?**

| You want to… | Use |
|---|---|
| Add or update named files — a config file, a workflow, a script, a Dockerfile | `custom_credential_write_files` |
| Read anything at all from GitHub | `custom_credential_make_request` (`GET`) |
| Start a workflow, or follow a run | `custom_credential_make_request` — see `references/actions.md` |
| Publish the **site's rendered static export** into a repo | `source_control_execute_commit` — see `references/source-control.md` |

Conflating the last row with the rest wastes real work. `source_control_execute_commit` runs a
fresh static export of the site and commits the resulting HTML and assets, and it **deletes** paths
it previously wrote that the export no longer produces. It is a publishing target, not a way to put
a file in a repository. A container build needs app source, and a rendered export is not app
source — a build fed the wrong one either fails or, worse, succeeds and ships a site with no
server. `references/source-control.md` states the difference in full; read it before you use
either tool for the first time in a task.

## Reporting rules

- **Report the stage you actually reached.** Queued is queued. Confirmed-but-unrun is not written.
- **Name the branch, the repository, and the commit** in your result. A commit SHA and URL come
  back from a successful write; use them rather than describing what you believe happened.
- **A declined confirmation is a real outcome, not an error.** Say the human declined and stop.
  Do not re-raise the dialog to see if they change their mind.
- **Never re-dispatch on a hunch.** A second run queued behind a broken one wastes the human's
  time and tells you nothing new.
- **Say what you left unverified.** A value you guessed, a branch you assumed, a placeholder you
  did not replace — each is a thing the human needs to know, not a detail.
